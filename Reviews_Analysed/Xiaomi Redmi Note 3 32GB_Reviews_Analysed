Great look  great performance the only reason for 4 star is low camera quality in low lightawesome gadget to have.
But one thing that has disappointed me very very much is the rear camera quality which I think is worse than Redmi Note 2 or even say Redmi 2 Prime.
THIS MOBILE VERY BESTGood mobile I like itWorst smartphone everVery very bad camera nd poor picture brightnesMusic is very bad.
I would like to tell u that those who are saying that the front camera is blurred are wrong u just have to remove the protector type layer and same goes for rear camera and fingerprint sensor.

Those who say that the camera isn t good dont compare camera of this phones to iphones or samsung that cost 30k or more and dont compare a camera s photo by its megapixel it mostly depends upon the quality of the camera oppo offer 50mp camera what do u think it would give photos better than iphone 6s plus   Video quality is also good    the 5mp front camera also takes good selfies2.

bad display  -5
Also its display is superb and Xiaomi has done brilliant job in built quality of note 3.
and now the display has gone bad.
The display is sharp and crystal clear with good viewing angles.
the phone is actually awesome except the camera quallty is average i can say  Display is very bad.
gold colour looks premium and even outshines other costly flagships in terms of looks and built qualityThe display is vid and processor is damn blazing fast.good display  19
The FHD display is just awesome.
Display looks good .
nice camera  nice display  nice battery backup  and most important is quick charger working nice.
this phone has heating issue otherwise this is a good phoneThe phone is as good as promoted  but I am a little disappointed with the automatic brightness  which tends to make the display too dark as evening falls.
Well build metal body with excellent display.
Excellent battery life  brilliant display  responsive touch   easy multitasking.
great call quality and display qualityAwesome mobile brilliant camera and high speed booting and excellent gaming performance no lagging or hangingDidn t like this phone at all.
5  inch HD display also looks brilliant .

Display is good.
Hi amazon buyers   i m from Rajasthan My review is based on 10 days after using this deviceFirst of all the display  it is very good and smooth then speed so speed is very fast.
Camera is good   display is amazing.
Touch  display sound  speed are perfect.
Its design and display soo good.
Great display great battery backups insanely nice performance1.
the display is awesome.
graceful display.
I mean in less than 15K you are getting top of the end features like 3GB RAM  fingerprint sensor and a good display and a massive battery.

in flash sale  -18
I ordered one already and gonna order one more in the next sale.
supparb phoneSmart choice would be buy this phone and dont look at othet phonesuse flash sale trick extension on your chrome for more chance to get this phone   i have added this 32 gb one through flash sale trick 1st timeawsm phone .
little bit in every phone some heating problem is there so you can go with some exceptionsGot the gold 3gb 32gb in the open sale.
I had been waiting to get my hands on this phone since the first flash sale.
I know it is easy to ride on a self balancer and keep on Hi5ing people but I guess Mi does not understand that there are 100 s and 100 s of people who would have loggedin for a false flash sale and then realise that it was a utter waste of time.
I got it in 4 may flash sale by using flash sale trick.
Amazing phone   got 2 of these bad boys one on flash sale and the other on open sale.
I got a redmi note 3 in flash sale on may 11.
The flash sale model sucks  but hang in there people.
I have tried 5 times at flash sale but it was worth trying.
I brought this product on 25th flash sale.
Not heated just like room temperatureAll negative reviews are mainly they don t get theMobile in flash sale.
once you register for flash sale in Flipkart than definitely you will get your mobile.
Camera quality is not that good at low light  outdoor buy fair quality for a phone at this price range   Good camera quality indoors even at low or no light because it has good flash even after zooming you will get a fine picture.
Moreover the purchase is done in a hurry as it was a flash sale and I have to complete within a matter of minutes .
So so frustrating sale this is.
Next flash sale on 4th may.
I can say the mobile is very nice for this budget   but the flash sale killed me .
Received 32gb phone today and after using it  i can say that please wait for little bit if you can t get this phone in flash sale it will be available in normal sale instead of going for other phone have Patience.
Guys i know this phone is highly demandable rite now and due to having this flash sale scenario which is so PATHETIC in my view  but if u wait for sometime more and try hard then i will surely suggest you for this.
I bought this after fighting to win it on flash sale for almost one and half month  and guess what happened.
This review is based on two days experience and will be updatedIn sale on June 1st I booked Redmi Note3 with 3 GB 32 GB model but received model with 2GB 16 GB.
The first device they launched in India was the MI3 and I got it in the first sale and it still works like the new device.
The actual rating for this product on amazon is less for this product because of frustrated customers who are not able to get the phone in flash sale.
It s very difficult to get one from the crazy flash sales.
I got it in flsah sale on 27th April and they delivered it on 2nd May .
It took me 3 attempts to crack the stupid Sale on 27 April.
Camera flash is not white.
Don t go with negative reviews its from those who didn t got this phone in flash sale or the haters who just want to spreading rumors.
Purchased in the flash sale this wednesday.
I bought this phone in June 1 open sale and got delivery yesterday.
All the best to everyone for the next flash sale.
However I was able to get this phone in 3rd flash sale.
Good phoneJust disappointed with flash sale.
I also use the 16 GB variant using it since first sale.
Cons   1  Availability  I really hate this so called flash sell strategies by both MI and Amazon.
i would like to see the same features in redmi note 4 along with 1 additional features with front flash for selfie lovers.
This issue really spoiled my experience og an otherwise great phoneGot this phone in flash sale in my first attempt  only.
Middle finger salute to xiaomi   amazon for creating such a hype due to this f. ing flash sale system.
phone is good but i hate this flash sale method.
But could not place the order as it was already full by 2 06 PMI am very upset with this flash sale system.
and xiaomiReceived my phone through the flash sale held on amazon on 6th April.
Got the phone after so much tries in the flash sale and finally got the phone.
I got it on first flash sale.
Aswome phoneGood productI was lucky to book on second sale though i purchased from my boss s account and after use of few days here are my review Battery  it has very good battery with great backup.
Nice phone super gaming speed no heng super viewgoodYes i didnt get this phone i am not going to say a single word about cellphone but what the heck this flash sale about  I registered apprx 4.
5 lacs registrations for this device for the first sale.
Nice Phone  Lucky enough to have this 32GB Gold Piece on very first flash sale on March 9th.
I am not sure if Mi realizes this ot now but they are actually axing their own leg with this kind of false flash sale which is there only to create a false hipe and demand.
It s really frustratingREAD IF YOU WANT THE PHONE  PI Bought the phone on the 6th of April via the flash sale.
Also lacks in multitaskingI have purchased the phone on flash sale of 16th March.
Every week I tried but not successful but booked in sale of 11th May and got in hand on 16th.
Very badNot goodits goodNice phonegood phoneFinally I got Note 3 3GB RAM   32GB MEMORY  in last sale.
Battery is not as good as its sounds  4000mAHOver HeatingAvg Camera definitely not for enthusiasts Sim Card Slot is little LooseSlipperyFake flash sale within second it says sold out and wishlist also full3star only because of camera xcept that the device is perfect for your handsThis is perfect phone and very much satisfied.
Will not waste time to buy flash sale.

xiaomi redmi note  13
m very sad with the performance of the phoneRedmi Note 3 is Best Phone under 15 k I purchased it on 18 May got after 3 days Nice product.
superb phone i liked it not heat much like lenovo k3 note battery back also good if u use the 4g internet and playing games normally  u ll get 1 day.
Redmi note3 32gb is good previously I was facing many problems but now all problems solved after new software update now it s awesome I suggest everyone can go for it no issues at all.
However I was a little bit disappointed with the packaging as the external bubble wrap was completely deflated and the internal xiaomi box had dents around the edges.
I think xiomi is making redmi note 3 with cheap and worst quality hardware for india than china.
U should not trust thisGo for moto x playIt s far better than thisRedmi Note 3It is good  but 1mm smaller so the is a slight gap after stickingNice phone.
The Redmi Note 3  Snapdragon  is the latest Note device they have in the International market right now  as they have already launched Redmi Note 2  Redmi Note 2 Prime and the Redmi Note 3 in outside India market but they all have the MediaTek processor and they have been prohibited from sale these MediaTek phones in India due to some patent issues  so they launched the Redmi Note Prime with Qualcomm s Snapdragon 410  which is not outdated yet but also not for the power user  especially for the Indians and Made in India and most users liked it but some power users didn t like this effort  Xiaomi heard their voice too and now we have Redmi Note 3 Snapdragon variant especially for the Indians and Made in India  powerful than all its MediaTek variants with starting price tag of Rs 9999 only for 2GB 16GB and 11999 for the 3GB 32GB model.
In all aspects I loved itRedmi note 3 32GB  is not a available product from Xiaomi.
Xiaomi make fool indian public.
The Redmi Note 3 is the first Xiaomi phone to sport a fingerprint scanner as well.
One suggestion  It would be better if Xiaomi provides Moto G like user interface for buttons instead of MIUI.
I was pretty much confused whether to buy redmi or zuk.
Redmi makes us fool by saying this that pic should be clicked with finger sensor.
So holding redmi note 3 is bit quite heavy or else no issue.
5 10Call quality on the Redmi Note 3 is excellent and the earpiece speaker is sufficiently loud even outdoors.
I Just Hated One thing which is I Waited 5 sales   ToughI am fully satisfied with the function but  regarding  UPGRADATION  Xiaomi  is silent and there is no service provided in Rajkot  one of the big city of Gujarat.
But one thing that has disappointed me very very much is the rear camera quality which I think is worse than Redmi Note 2 or even say Redmi 2 Prime.
i have compared this phone s frnt camera with lenovo k4 note and its much better.
Faster than faster phoneAmazing mobileMi note 3No hang problemVery good product in reasonable price compare to all other mobile in the market.
my first xiaomi mobile .
When it s  available  to meRedmi note 3 gold mi chiyei am buying this phone at 2nd sale   once again amazon is my favorite list.
Only problem I found is weak signal reception  areas where other smartphones pick 1 or 2 bars of signal xiaomi just gives up and that is a big problem.
Finally i ordered redmi note 3  gold 32gp.
I had hear so much about the xiaomi miui 7 software which is full of features  but this phone is not able to provide stable data connection to MTNL subscribers.
my request for xiaomi is please check the issue and please give me a true piece of xiaomi redmi note 3 Gold 32gb.
All features in mi phones are best in quality and price i had its 1st redmi 1s since then i own all its products like mi PAD tablet redmi prime redmi note3  mi piston ear phone and mi metal ear phones.
I own other Xiaomi phones too .
expected best from Redmi .
Couple of inclusions by Xiaomi which could have made it perfect 1.
It would be good  if xiaomi provided rubber coating on cornerThe best handset i have ever experienced   comparing to samsung   other phones  regarding features   cost.
Camera  quality of redmi note 3 is very inferior poor.
It is more upgraded than xiaomi Redmi note 3.
5gb  now I have only 21gb available in my new mi note 3.
Overall xiaomi redmi note 3 is good product except camera quality and back flash light is not up to the mark.
So my beautiful smartphone was everything working like GPS  accelerator  WiFi  except  i cannot make calls  This is a basic thing a phone should do  it doesn t even have to be a smartphone to do this So  i have understood how Xiaomi can sell phones so cheap  they just skip the quality inspection and save money.
Otherwise services  provided by amazon is goodI bought  redmi from 13 th April sale on mi.
Low light photography is not so good  xiaomi is expected to gave the update that will fix the low light camera issues.
ulta Xiaomi wale ka karjdar ban gaya.
Very nice phone and thanks for Amazon for quick delivery because I was very excited to see my redmi note3 .
Also please buy screenguard from Xiaomi original only.
It is absent in redmi note 3 and the gallery in asus have collage and other beautification options which is also absent in redmi note 3.

bad quality  -21
Camera quality is not that good at low light  outdoor buy fair quality for a phone at this price range   Good camera quality indoors even at low or no light because it has good flash even after zooming you will get a fine picture.
5 inch and one more feature with touch unlock camera quality not very good its an average i give overall 3 staramazing phone at this pricePhone is very much heating at the time of charging  charger also heating very much.
Love itUI is good  battery i will give it 9 out of 10  no heating issue as hear by many review site  no lagging  smooth performance  display quality is good but not superb as it is measuring for full hd  sound quality is also little bit more than okay  but camera is only satisfactory.
Camera Quality is not good.

5  Call quality sometimes low and sometimes too high.
the display screen isn t a gorilla glass as it is not mentioned by the company but it is good quality and can absord light shocks.
The build quality of Redmi Note 3 feels like premium quality just like Xiaomi Mi3.
The only drawback is the camera  although 16 MP  the Low light picture quality is not satisfactory  although it is great in good lighting conditions.
Camera quality good  and front camera is not good.

usage  -10
Could you imagine an android device lasting over 2 days of heavy usage without charge  Mine lasts about 3 days with normal use  And this does not affect its performance at all.
Now this is really intriguing as lot of review videos on youtube say that it doesn t heat on heavy usage.
awesome battery it lasted 3 days on normal usage and a day on heavy usage.
With heavy usage you do need to worry about battery for a day.
Very nice stylish and comfy miui is easy and convenient heavy usage also battery stands a long upto 1 day camera quality is not as much expected.
Can it be replaced now  The level of rate of reduction of battery reduces after every consecutive charge where when initially bought the battery lasted 3 days where now it lasts for 2 days with similar usage  another problem is the miui since it consumes 50.
5 to 2 days on heavy usage.
not noticeable on extended usage.
Battery  4000MAH battery gives performance from morning 7AM to evening 8PM in 4G SIM of Jio in heavy usage for moderate usage you can run battery upto 10 TO 11PM.
2 days from a single charge for casual usage.
5 to 2 days in normal moderate usage.
Coming to the battery life  it is just awesome  can pull off one day of heavy usage pretty easily.
It lasts a whole day with heavy usage and still good to go.
Fast and quick processing  reflects the true usage of 3gb ram4.
with moderate to heavy usage I got backup of 30 hours with this phone which is so amazing.
gets little hot when loaded  that is natural with almost all phones I get a about 4 day battery life for my usage  relieves me from almost daily charging Love it.
Everything is superb be it gaming experience  call quality or other everyday usage.

Fingerprint scanner is one of the best I ever seen.
All scanner works perfectly  fine   fingerprint scanner is quite decent.
Fingerprint scanner works fine and the best thing is that you can unlock the device without using the lock button simply by putting your finger on the scanner  In iphone you have to press the lock home button to wake up the device and then put the finger .
And the fingerprint scanner is really good   but I ve experienced some minor issues relating to it like it doesn t recognize when my finger is oily or sweaty   my finger needs to be dry.
Fingerprint scanner is very very accurate and fast  If u register it correctly IR blaster works with peel remote app and works good.
Battery life  fingerprint scanner  is good.

This phone I got tody Really its awsom everything as accepted  but who are players of android then I say no don t buy because The operating system is based on  mui 7 the Android 5 is not here experience  actually they want leg android as and leads mui.
I am sure that this problem is related to handset only not with the network as everything was ok when i was using earlier handset.
Everything is just awesome.
If you are gamer geek u would probably know everything gets heat due to graphics of game so don t blame handset if it gets heated.
Rest everything is excellent.
Everything is superb be it gaming experience  call quality or other everyday usage.
Rest everything are good.

thanks to amazon  8
One day dilivery of amazon is great on time aspect but i Received a defective damaged piece.
Packaging was neither bubble wrapped nor in Amazon pouch.
And amazon is better than other in fast   good packing delivery.
As usual Amazon delivery was superb.
HiAmazon   i am using amazon first time and i am facing lot of problem with you and your services   i hope that you will give me good response against MI gold 32GB so i can use again Amazon in future.
The actual rating for this product on amazon is less for this product because of frustrated customers who are not able to get the phone in flash sale.
Flash sale of amazon is horrible.
Amazon was good as usuall.
I have started replacement process  and hoping that its better if Amazon refund money.
amazon this is wrong.
Amazon is super.
Not easy Amazon refund policy like Flipkart.
Amazon is always amazing.
Amazon is really good at that.
Can anyone provide solution for this as mobiles are not accepted for return in amazon Amazon Delivery was Bang on.
Had been a mi user and avid Amazon fan but this buy is dissatisfying.
AMAZON great work  i was updated every moment regarding my order status and impressed with amazon service.
flipkart is far better than amazon.
5 stars to Amazon for such a great courier network.
The sale atleast at Amazon is not fake.
I hate Amazon flash sale and mi open saleGot unlucky with a disaster piece.
3  keep trying Amazon via the app and PC both.

mi note  8
5gb  now I have only 21gb available in my new mi note 3.
So holding redmi note 3 is bit quite heavy or else no issue.
Faster than faster phoneAmazing mobileMi note 3No hang problemVery good product in reasonable price compare to all other mobile in the market.
When it s  available  to meRedmi note 3 gold mi chiyei am buying this phone at 2nd sale   once again amazon is my favorite list.
I m using Redmi 1s which is manufactured in China seems to be better than MI note 3.
NICE PRODUCT AND GOOD SERVICE BY AMAZON ALSOAll things are good but only heating problemPhone is amazing but service of amazon is very poorFor mi note 3 mobile.
Camera  quality of redmi note 3 is very inferior poor.
I have been a Samsung user for a decad now and now with the news of Mi Note 3 launch I had made up my mind to switch to Mi for good.
It is absent in redmi note 3 and the gallery in asus have collage and other beautification options which is also absent in redmi note 3.
I am using Remi Note 2 for the past 1 and half years with out any major issues.
I think xiomi is making redmi note 3 with cheap and worst quality hardware for india than china.
Finally i ordered redmi note 3  gold 32gp.
Front camera is good compared other phones which have via or 1mp cameraJust the span of 15 days time  my new MI Note 3 Charger not working.
in red mi note 3 battery backup is good.
U should not trust thisGo for moto x playIt s far better than thisRedmi Note 3It is good  but 1mm smaller so the is a slight gap after stickingNice phone.
5 10Call quality on the Redmi Note 3 is excellent and the earpiece speaker is sufficiently loud even outdoors.
The Redmi Note 3  Snapdragon  is the latest Note device they have in the International market right now  as they have already launched Redmi Note 2  Redmi Note 2 Prime and the Redmi Note 3 in outside India market but they all have the MediaTek processor and they have been prohibited from sale these MediaTek phones in India due to some patent issues  so they launched the Redmi Note Prime with Qualcomm s Snapdragon 410  which is not outdated yet but also not for the power user  especially for the Indians and Made in India and most users liked it but some power users didn t like this effort  Xiaomi heard their voice too and now we have Redmi Note 3 Snapdragon variant especially for the Indians and Made in India  powerful than all its MediaTek variants with starting price tag of Rs 9999 only for 2GB 16GB and 11999 for the 3GB 32GB model.
--------------------------------------------------------
miui  8
MIUI is excellent  do install peel remote application for using it as a universal remote.
Very nice stylish and comfy miui is easy and convenient heavy usage also battery stands a long upto 1 day camera quality is not as much expected.
But overall its good phone less with lot of amazing feature good miui good battery backup crisp display panel audio output is good here and lot more inbuilt features.
MiUi is very user friendly  simple  loved it.
Also  the MIUI is pretty bad .
You can t get better phone with 12kSuper smooth  Ui is awesome  I m familiar with miui so it gets better the fingerprint sensor was awesome  It s just awesome I have tried multiple times since past 3 weeks to buy this phone.
memory management is hard to get after u regularly update ur phone but MIUI is best after all.
MIUI is beautiful to operate and its fantastic.
b  The MIUI is rather unique to customize.
It has an animated profile picture feature called Showtime which lets other MIUI users see your animated selfies when you call them  instead of a profile picture.
TOO MUCH POOR PHONE QUALITY PHONEBest Phone with Great Hardware and awesome MIUI.
Miui is superb.
--------------------------------------------------------
a long time  -7
It is so so so bad product delivery I hat Amazoni have been iphone user  for a long time now and was planning to shift to android platform for some time.
it may not work sometimes after you take it out of your pocket after a long time but else it work just fine .
Auto Rotation  Gyro Sensor  often stops working the solution given from MI team for this is to reset the phone    my Solution to temporary resolve restart the phone  often if the phone is locked for a long time   any app running in the background the finger print unlock doesn t work.
I am play games doing internet for long time.
Xiami rocks  I am sorry Xiami for underestimating for quite a long time now.
Quick charge would be great but charging 4000 mah required quite long time.
I was using the camera app today for a quite a long time it started to heat.
hope it will work fine for longer time  I loved this phone and got on 9 may 2016 i must say its a worth mobile to buy in this price bracket.
--------------------------------------------------------
update  -7
Company is agreed to incorporate this camera night vision issue in next update.
It provide MIUI 7 update which is good.
No heating problems  call quality is very good  speaker is adequately loud and everything works well except fingerprint touch to take selfie and fingerprint to unlock apps but it will be there in next update so no worries.
Samsung Note 2   OnePlus 2   Vibe   redMI note 3Good phone  but only unit can be purchased  always good service from Amazon Friends Dont buy this phone this phone Camera qualities is too much poor after update now also this phone screen resulation give too much dark and camera results too much dark and red too much poor quality friends this company create artificial demand.
Hope the problem will be solved in the next update.
The new update which allows you to lock apps and take selfies with your fingerprint is also very nice .
The Best part is that I have been using the phone for just 2 weeks and I have already got new Update  I can even click photos wit Finger Print  How Awesome.
Still a stable update is not yet released.
No marshmallow update so far.
hope its a software conflict   hope xiaomi fixes this issue in the next update.
Browsed and checked that almost all Redmi Note 3 Users facing the same issue after a recent update.
3 global update preinstalled ram is too good 1.

slot for memory  6
I love itheat problem while charging and it hang when you use external memory.
Cons Should  have separate slot for memory  card.
This was not expected  you should have provided extra slot for external memory card.
But mobile does not have separate memory slot.
Stop adverstising for 128 expandable memory  its only 32gb memory we can use.
32GB is good internal memory with 3GB RAM.
because its secondary slot can be used as either sim or sd.
If you need to use external memory card then you have to comprmise with only one sim.
i didnt like hybrid slot concept at all.
55  of the ram and the camera has no autofocus and the usable memory is also very low around 25 gb.
And now I can t even return this item and look for better phones with much more expandable memory options.
Good Memory management  no need to kill apps now and then.
You can t use 2 sim cards along with external memory card.
But this phone generally doesn t need a memory card support as it is having an internal memory of 32 GB.
tasking and memory intensive programs but if you have 1 GB RAM free  it is a waste.
--------------------------------------------------------
in redmi note  5
But one thing that has disappointed me very very much is the rear camera quality which I think is worse than Redmi Note 2 or even say Redmi 2 Prime.
Camera  quality of redmi note 3 is very inferior poor.
When it s  available  to meRedmi note 3 gold mi chiyei am buying this phone at 2nd sale   once again amazon is my favorite list.
Finally i ordered redmi note 3  gold 32gp.
Redmi note3 32gb is good previously I was facing many problems but now all problems solved after new software update now it s awesome I suggest everyone can go for it no issues at all.
I think xiomi is making redmi note 3 with cheap and worst quality hardware for india than china.
All features in mi phones are best in quality and price i had its 1st redmi 1s since then i own all its products like mi PAD tablet redmi prime redmi note3  mi piston ear phone and mi metal ear phones.
It is absent in redmi note 3 and the gallery in asus have collage and other beautification options which is also absent in redmi note 3.
So holding redmi note 3 is bit quite heavy or else no issue.
U should not trust thisGo for moto x playIt s far better than thisRedmi Note 3It is good  but 1mm smaller so the is a slight gap after stickingNice phone.

--------------------------------------------------------
in price range  5
One of best in this price range Ignore  haters .
You can t expect a better phone than this within the price range of 12k available on the market.
This phone beats any other phones in this price range on this feature and some other phones which are of higher price too.
although it struggles in low light for camara but it s fine for this price range.
camera is good which you ll rarely find in such price range.
Although its quite good in this price range.
Camera is average but with this price range is good.
camera clarity is too good   All the features in this price range is not available in any other brands .
I strongly recommend this phone who are looking in a economic price rangeXiaomi is just one and half year old brand for India and it took only one year to beat all other old and big brands just because of their business model  price  quality  and MIUI.
--------------------------------------------------------
software  4
1star less due to software issuesOnly initial views .
Then how come it is heating with the use of camera  I have an Indian make unit and have upgraded to the latest software update.
And hardware and software is also good.
My brother had bought a coolpad note 3 lite and most reviewers say that it s software is buggy but at least it provides decent call quality and stable mobile data connection across all mobile networks and that s what most user want.
I think Xiaomi not tested the devices properly  these problems are really irritating and software fix is a must otherwise I would like to have the refund as this is already a replacement of the first device.
Redmi note3 32gb is good previously I was facing many problems but now all problems solved after new software update now it s awesome I suggest everyone can go for it no issues at all.
Liye hua 1 month hua aur software ud gya .
Great hardware with a great software  at reasonable price  that is rare combination found in this phone.
Updated the software and made it even good.
But i think its a software gimmick.
software updXiaomi Redmi Note 3  Gold  32GB i love this product nice sellerGo for asus zenfone.

note 3 gold  3
I like the product and the product is really very good and the gold color is the best.
good battery life as well good looksphone built is very good and looks sleek  especially in gold.
When it s  available  to meRedmi note 3 gold mi chiyei am buying this phone at 2nd sale   once again amazon is my favorite list.
Last but not the least Gold color of the phone is just so classy .
As far as the phone is concerned  Gold looks Good  and the phone has good amount of Features.
HiAmazon   i am using amazon first time and i am facing lot of problem with you and your services   i hope that you will give me good response against MI gold 32GB so i can use again Amazon in future.
Finally i ordered redmi note 3  gold 32gp.
The color Gold is great.
and its awesome go for itAlready posted review on grey model  except for colour   review remains same  gold looks good  but u can clearly make out the difference in qaulity when compared to an iPhone  but let s not forget this costs 12000  I bought 2 gold and one grey  prefer the grey more being a guy.
Redmi Note 3  Gold  32GB  is just awesome.
--------------------------------------------------------
viewing angles  3
The colours look natural and it has a good viewing angles.
The display is sharp and crystal clear with good viewing angles.
but heating is normal issue after all its metal body look crazy u fell like its gold look get attract well n display quality is brilliant clear look and best viewing angles.

review  3
Here my genuine review for all the people who really want to buy this phone but little bit confused because of the previous reviewsI don t know why people having problems in their redmi note 3Mine is working perfect fine.
DOverall   Fully satisfied  DAfter working 7 day I have give my review.
If they do so i will come again and write positive review.
This is a honest review.
dont go with negative review all are false.
Return policy has over so will try to solve with xiaomi service centre n I already read service center review n not much optimistic to get help from there.
--------------------------------------------------------
worth  -3
overall worth for the given price.
Deep patelBest phoneNice phoneGood phoneAwesome  both redmi note 3 and Amazon service and by God s grace the delivery was made on my birthday  thanks  for that and its been 3 days the device performance is way too good worth it.
camera could have been made better   but at this price  i wont complainAwsome mobile worth buying it for that price Redmi note3 is truly a best flagship phone for less prize.
--------------------------------------------------------
replacement  -3
AMAZON is ever ready with REPLACEMENT solution.
Then I order for replacement but not happy with that also and was facing the same problem in new device and finally I decided to return  and got the refund.
Replacement is not worth at all.
I do not know why they do not now accept the return when there is genuine problem in the phone and replacement will not be able to shove the problem.
What if this device too turns out bad  But this replacement phones seems OK till now.
But  I was really worried about the replacement after my first experience with Xiaomi.
--------------------------------------------------------
dual sim  3
really great phone with most of the feature it includes as per the technology need i m giving this review after using 3 days of the phone no problem at all in this phone super most features and functions works well and heavy battery backup must buyOnly problem os that either we use dual sim or we use one sim or one sd card otherwise phone is bestAmazing fastest phone with cheaper price.
we can use only dual sim or one sim and memory card.
company says its dual sim handset with sd.
2. no issues with dual sim.
I am listing out some of the pros and cons below Pros  Superfast processor  amazing looks  sharpness of the screen  customization options  very reasonably priced for the features offeredCons  Hybrid dual sim  if you use the second sim  you cannot use external SD card  no earphones  no  gorilla glassThe rose gold colour looks very rich and is not blingy at all  I would certainly recommend this phone to people who are not brand conscious and those who want more bang for the buck.
Nice battery back up with dual SIM .
card slot but its either dual sim handset or single sim with sd.
Looking around the device  on the left hand edge you have the dual SIM card slots  at the base there is a microUSB charging and data transfer port  on the right hand edge you have the volume rocker and power standby buttons.
Sim aur memory card install slot bakwash hai aur dual sim use karna kafi difficult hai.
I have tested almost all the functionalities  only need to check the dual sim stuff.
But u cant use ur dual Sim n SD card at a tym.
Go for it There should be independently dual sim not hybrid sim.
I don t like this phone in the time no dual sim use sd card use one sim note use  2  no service center in Patiala my charger not work I change but no service center some havey games loding and phone hanging low cost coolpad note 3 proper work game but xioami phone hangvery well going satisfied with its vidoe   photo quality 16MP  fingerprint access is also fast  only lag is after so many times finger access sometime fingerprint does not access  that time I clean finger scanner with cloth  and it starts working again ok. After many days trying to get this I got it finally.
either dual sim or single sim with memory card.
The Redmi Note 3 comes with a hybrid dual SIM Card slot and can take in two 4G SIM cards which are hot.

network  -3
I Was check different mobile in same place   but very poor network in Redmi  note3.
A bug is when you are using prefer network type is 3g or 2g then network signal downs as  3.
Good Product but when used with heavy operation its heats up slightlyAll over the product is good but it is not able to detect 4g network.
Mobile data connection is also not good even when using 4G  4G network speed is just average  many a times network drops.
It heats up while charging and to add to the worst it has network problems.
no issue with network and 3G but 4G is really awesome whenever I am in office  4G network not available near my home .
Best in Every AspectIt only find 2g network.
I did not face any major network issues .
It is unable to find 3g network after so many try.
Heating issue hanging issue3G network is not catchingExcellent phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
playing games  3
All other games  Modern combat 5  Real race 3  Subway surfers  spider.
No lagging issues noticed till now even on heavy games like ashpalt8  etc.
All heavy games work without any lag.
I ve tried playing games and all and The Processor and Ram handles everything well under control.
superb phone i liked it not heat much like lenovo k3 note battery back also good if u use the 4g internet and playing games normally  u ll get 1 day.
It plays all the heavy games like NOAH 3 GTA san andreas.
Though these phone has little heating issues while playing heavy games  but redmi 3 has no such heating issues during usage.
Its unbearable when I playing games and watching videos in YouTube.
i installed asphalt   defense zone 2hd  marvel fight and many other games.
money  good performance with no specific slowness issues identified and can play graphic intensive games  however it does take much longer to load individual game sequences  for example if you are playing Need for Speed or Modern Combat  then it takes about a minute for a new game to load  but once loaded  the gameplay is smooth till the finish .
I don t think these all games are problematic and hence the problem is with the device.
In low light condition camera is so poor in day light performance is good amount of detail so if you buy this phones  check this  below review1  heating issues2 some time fingerprint not work properly3 average camera performance Good point of  rn31 good battery2 performance is so good multi tasking3 good amount of displayMany games used to hang in between.
No such heating issue except while charging Honestly not yet checked on heavy games.
If you are a gamer please note that heavy games like gangster vegas and gta san andreas will lagI jst luv ths mobile but plz sa how to open chat head of fb messengerIts nt gting openedPlz samy collegue using phone .
Super awesomeeeOnly battery heating issue when I play games otherwise great.
I don t like this phone in the time no dual sim use sd card use one sim note use  2  no service center in Patiala my charger not work I change but no service center some havey games loding and phone hanging low cost coolpad note 3 proper work game but xioami phone hangvery well going satisfied with its vidoe   photo quality 16MP  fingerprint access is also fast  only lag is after so many times finger access sometime fingerprint does not access  that time I clean finger scanner with cloth  and it starts working again ok.

sim card slot  -2
really great phone with most of the feature it includes as per the technology need i m giving this review after using 3 days of the phone no problem at all in this phone super most features and functions works well and heavy battery backup must buyOnly problem os that either we use dual sim or we use one sim or one sd card otherwise phone is bestAmazing fastest phone with cheaper price.
we can use only dual sim or one sim and memory card.
The SIM 2 slot can also accommodate a Micro SD card but at the cost of the phone being used as a single SIM phone.
One more thing is that it handles an hybrid SIM Card Slot whcih means you can either use a second sim or a memory card in the hybrid slot.
But u cant use ur dual Sim n SD card at a tym.
The Redmi Note 3 comes with a hybrid dual SIM Card slot and can take in two 4G SIM cards which are hot.
some people complain that they have problems that the nano sim takes a lot of time to read and connect to a network but i havent used both sims but a sdcard instead of second sim so cant tell u if its a problem but my sdcard was instanly read.
I am listing out some of the pros and cons below Pros  Superfast processor  amazing looks  sharpness of the screen  customization options  very reasonably priced for the features offeredCons  Hybrid dual sim  if you use the second sim  you cannot use external SD card  no earphones  no  gorilla glassThe rose gold colour looks very rich and is not blingy at all  I would certainly recommend this phone to people who are not brand conscious and those who want more bang for the buck.
Thanks to Xiaomibattery is not working as good as first 5 day and front camera also not so goodKisi ko redmi note3 32 gb chahiye kyaMera order ho gya he7089484947Nice phoneHave some issues with bsnl sim  cardsOverall a nice phoneEverything is good.
U can use a sdcard if u want but it will take space of ur second sim nano  so u can have 1 sim and 1sdcard or 2sims with no sdcard.

phone is absolute superbbut not a network with 2nd sim inserted like uninor or telenor sim cardthanking youAfter a long wait  finally into my cart  I know this phone is too good for this price tag.
I don t like this phone in the time no dual sim use sd card use one sim note use  2  no service center in Patiala my charger not work I change but no service center some havey games loding and phone hanging low cost coolpad note 3 proper work game but xioami phone hangvery well going satisfied with its vidoe   photo quality 16MP  fingerprint access is also fast  only lag is after so many times finger access sometime fingerprint does not access  that time I clean finger scanner with cloth  and it starts working again ok.

this phone allows you one micro sim one nano sim   memory card which it comes with  n no signal issue.
either dual sim or single sim with memory card.
Not able to use duel sim with memory card.

at price range  2
camera clarity is too good   All the features in this price range is not available in any other brands .
This phone beats any other phones in this price range on this feature and some other phones which are of higher price too.
One of best in this price range Ignore  haters .
I strongly recommend this phone who are looking in a economic price rangeXiaomi is just one and half year old brand for India and it took only one year to beat all other old and big brands just because of their business model  price  quality  and MIUI.
--------------------------------------------------------
excellent  2
but camera could be still betterNice phone with a few bugs but it s okay Excellent product and delivery is on timeFine till now.
its have faciliy toscann  paper gud flip battery excellent good mobile in this rangPhone was good.
--------------------------------------------------------
with redmi note  2
I think xiomi is making redmi note 3 with cheap and worst quality hardware for india than china.
The Redmi Note 3  Snapdragon  is the latest Note device they have in the International market right now  as they have already launched Redmi Note 2  Redmi Note 2 Prime and the Redmi Note 3 in outside India market but they all have the MediaTek processor and they have been prohibited from sale these MediaTek phones in India due to some patent issues  so they launched the Redmi Note Prime with Qualcomm s Snapdragon 410  which is not outdated yet but also not for the power user  especially for the Indians and Made in India and most users liked it but some power users didn t like this effort  Xiaomi heard their voice too and now we have Redmi Note 3 Snapdragon variant especially for the Indians and Made in India  powerful than all its MediaTek variants with starting price tag of Rs 9999 only for 2GB 16GB and 11999 for the 3GB 32GB model.

wifi  -1
the speed of WiFi is also less then the other devices using the same wifi network.
I switched on the phone  completed the set up wizard  mobile network and WiFi connected instantly and I was very happy.
No Captive Portal for the WiFi need Third Party app  Connecting to a WiFi is very Slow.
--------------------------------------------------------
love  1
The product is not as expectedI love Xiaomi redmi note 3 because it is not just a perfect cellphone  it is a good value for your money as well.
5 10 but still goodInternal memory hugeOnly thing is size of sim one is micro other is nanoAnd u can t put memory card when using both sims at same timeOverall very happy with productI LOVE THIS PHONE TOO MUCHAt last the beast arrive.
--------------------------------------------------------
moto g4  1
What u people want  To create unnecessary hype or to provide the product to customer  Really fed up  Going for other options like moto g4 best in class.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  -1
Only 1 sim and sd card can be used at a time Mobile grip not so goodSystem apps can t be disabled and apps can t be moved to sd card.
8gb wasted for unwanted preinstalled apps.
U cannot move apps to sd card but it is better because apps will run lag free if they are directly ran from strorage and takes less time to load their data files   .
browsing is nice  using apps are great.
I have all social apps and a few games installed.
Can t browse Internet using Chrome or other Apps  though Watsapp and some Apps are working.
Tested using multiple apps running at background more that 15 apps  few are small few are games few are inbuilt apps .
Password lock for apps is good  we can lock apps to avoid friends family peep in to personnel apps.
2gb ram free with much installed apps.
--------------------------------------------------------
hexa core  -1
For starters  the Redmi Note 3 comes with Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 SoC which houses a hexa core processor  with a dual core Cortex A72 processor clocked at 1.
--------------------------------------------------------
amazing  -1
Very good phone but camera could have been improved  performance is very good Amazing product  With no complaints.
--------------------------------------------------------
16 mp  -1
while charging phone heated upto minimum 40 degree and camera is not as good as 16 mp should be.
One bad thing about its  camera  camera is not like 16 mp but it s like 12 mp but it s ok but front camera is pretty good it take original pictures.
The company is claiming to have camera of 16 MP capable of giving excellent photo quality.
--------------------------------------------------------
sd card  1
I am listing out some of the pros and cons below Pros  Superfast processor  amazing looks  sharpness of the screen  customization options  very reasonably priced for the features offeredCons  Hybrid dual sim  if you use the second sim  you cannot use external SD card  no earphones  no  gorilla glassThe rose gold colour looks very rich and is not blingy at all  I would certainly recommend this phone to people who are not brand conscious and those who want more bang for the buck.
--------------------------------------------------------
in low light  -1
front camera damn good in day light but low light photos are average.
I love the camera it s amazing I ve tested it a small light indor prblm but the pictures came out amazing and it s very light in weight after my Micromax now I m fully happy vth redmi note 3 .
It s compact and light.
although it struggles in low light for camara but it s fine for this price range.
Poor indoors and low light.
primary cam is not that much good it does not capture good pics in dull light.
The only two minor issues are that the pictures are not good in low light.
Camera quality is not that good at low light  outdoor buy fair quality for a phone at this price range   Good camera quality indoors even at low or no light because it has good flash even after zooming you will get a fine picture.
camera is poor in low light.
Camera In case of camera department I compared this phone with Asus ZenFone 2 laser back camera of redmi note 3 is 16MP and that of ZenFone is 13MP doesn t care about megapixel range in case of back camera ZenFone has a slight edge because of the performance in low light and the camera app of ZenFone carries a lot of features including super resolution low light depth field beatification mode manual mode slow motion time lapse etc.
colour reproduction is not that great and even under low light images are so noisy.
Better battery backupBetter build qualityFingerprint sensorIR blasterValue for MoneyCons  Average Camera  indoor pictures are not that great even low light .
Not to criticize about it but pictures taken from my oppo F1 13MP  has the same clarity like it and in low light  without flash  has disappointed me.
It takes excellent pics in day light and the pics in low light are decent compared to its price.
Camera   Rear camera does good job in day light conditions but in low light it suffer little bit.
One hand system lagsCamera is good but don t expect good pics in low light sometimes quality may differ too.
red and white which adds true color even in low artificial light .
0 aperture lets in sufficient light to click great images even when the ambient lighting is low.
Only con i can say is Camera performance in artificial light.
Overall xiaomi redmi note 3 is good product except camera quality and back flash light is not up to the mark.
I m not that much happy about camera is very good in bright light and close up shots are also very good but photos look little washed out and in low light it struggles alot.
camera under low light is below par.
But this is not good in low light.
focus function which works great in well lit situations  but struggles in low light.
Low light photography is not so good  xiaomi is expected to gave the update that will fix the low light camera issues.
The camer flash got a light reddish mix with white light which sometimes makes the photos in low light a little fake coloured.
--------------------------------------------------------
flash sales  1
Still how many years ur flash sales going we are going to meizu3 note thuuuuuiuu fake productPremium feel.
these flash sales are fakeAfter a long wating finally i got wht i wnt  good phone in 12k  MI queality is very gudPhone launch of three and four is fooling.
Amazon did a brilliant job on delivery of this phoneI got this phone after a long struggle of 6 flash sales and was so frustrated in between that i decided to go for another one .
It s very difficult to get one from the crazy flash sales.
Company should stop fooling its customer   1st by that annoying flash sales and then by selling such problamatic handsetsHi I bought Xiaomi Redmi Note 3  Gold  32GB  during sale on 27th April and got my phone on 1st MayI don t understand why people are complaing about this product.
NOTE  if you were set on buying this phone BUT got frustrated because of the flash sales and all.
Got it after trying in 4 flash sales.
They are giving 1 star just because they are not able to get the phone in flash sales.
Since in the earlier flash sales the product got sold out literally in a flash I decided to set up 4 PCs with an impressive internet connection and got my gang to help out.
I tried on all the flash sales on Mi as well as on the Mi site but before it starts it would say out of stock.
Nahhh just kidding  Hours of Time wasted on flash sales pays off.
Not worth wasting valuable time in flash sales for this phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
2 days  1
I thought i may have received a defective piece  so i requested for replacement  which Amazon gave in 2 days  brilliant service .
on wifi and mobile data  I got 2 complete days.
Will be glad if I can go for 2 days without charging Gets warm while cheesing but otherwise remains cool to touch.
can last 2 days easily.
1  Little bit heavy 2 Still don t find any other its just 10 days and hope no cons in future.
