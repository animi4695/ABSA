bad_sound  -88
 7. sound is low but with dolby it is good .
tried many ways to recover like dolby atmos settings change  app for sound better sound qualiy etc.
the loud speaker sound is little low.
4. sound quality is also not goog.
My view is that Lenovo phones are not good in quality and will advise propective buyers to better avoid this brand of phone.
Sound quality is very good clear and loud but only when Good quality of earphones like Sony is used.
Its a nice phone if we are talking about features but it will disappoint you in terms of quality sound quality is good but speaker is moody touch screen will create problem very soon after buying it charger is also of low quality.
Power saver  blink eye photo capture  double tap to screen on  dolby sound  wide touch and many more extra features which make your device smart
Dolby Atmos is good  only via headphones  but since the sound engine produces so little sound that its impact can t be felt much.
While charging Charger makes a hissing sound.
Not having any good quality.
4  it has a low sound  i have set the volume levels at the highest point  but still it is unclear while attending the call.
camear quality superb  sound a huge plus point to this phone.
Only the sound quality is not so good as advertised.
sound quality was too bad  too low.
Most disappointing thing about this phone is that the ear phones aren t good for music  i should rather say they re very bad  the sound s very feeble which you can hardly hear in a noisy crowd which we re used to.
Poor sound quality cheapest material Front camera is similar to 2 mp.
dont know why people are writing in their review that camera quality is not good.
but in lenovo A7000 there many issue Heating   hang up   headphone sound is very bad.
somebody told in reviews sound not in high because he gives only flat equalizer u should configure your own its better u have dolby featured lenovo laptop then u can easily configure equalizer if no u can configure according to ur taste of sound.
 I have a brought this product and it is looking good  working well  internal memory was less and picture quality is low  8GB  after I brought this Lenovo have released within less than a month with 16GB version mobile with better features.
Sound quality is not so great and even the so called ATMOS dolby is useless.
dont go for lenovo not good quality wise touch wise.
Not a good Quality mobile in terms of material used to built.
Back Cover looks good but the build quality poor  3.
Sound quality is low in company provided headphones if we use another headphones then sound quality is loud and clear.
Camera quality is not at all good.
Everyone says  sound is not great.
Camera quality is not very good.
camera not good  Sound quality is good but volume is too low.
Battery is sticked with back panel and it doesn t come out and when i push it harder sound comes from back panel.
 Good mobile low sound but after many days its battery backup is lowGood mobile low sound but after many days its battery backup is low 
with headphone it become like nokia 1100 sound.
Sound quality is good but not louder  very low sound.
Sound is loud and clear.
After using the mobile it was found that the MP3 sound was not audible.
camera is not too good but ok   external sound is not enough powerful   still no update 2 android 5.
Best feature  Best screen  too light weight  very slim  good sound quality.
1. sound quality and headphone are very low quality.
I checked it with my other old earphones then to my surprise the sound was too good.
SOUND OUTPUT  Sound out put sadly is really really low.
Screen Quality is not that good
the screen guard that comes with the box is not of good quality  better to buy one from outside and the headphone looks very cheap  white color .
Call Quality  call quality has been good and the phone signal reception too has been good.
Speaker sound is lame.
speaker phone mode sound is low.
Overall is good but camera quality is low as accepted 
I loved this phone it sound quality is good it is slim good looking not heavy weight camera is nice front camera is nice with features like blink play and hand shake capture touch is working good u should go for it and did not read positive reviews there is no touch problem design is also nice and best is battery.
I am using since May 2015  working is good but sound quality is not acceptable for this phone because it is in poor quality.
very bad sound quality
The phone is nice but sound quality is very low.
Voice quality is not good.
dear all let me tell u phone is superb performance wise but it has poorest sound quality in headfone and even we cant hear properly the songs  
it should have good speaker they have only provided one speaker at the back but Dolby Atmos is superb if you are using premium headphones  stock headphone quality is not that good you have to buy good head phones to enjoy Dolby Atmos feature.
 as per my experience As I own Most Xiaomi and Lenovo Phones  Users that want Very good sound and Very good camera go for XIAOMI phones Redmi 2   MI4   MI4i   Note  but.
Camera  Front camera is a bit good but the rear camera is not as much good as it should be but at this cost its ok. Speaker  the speaker quality is very good.
Though accessories are not of good quality  but that s ok 
i received this mobile today and got headphone sound is very low.
Audio quality is not good.
Camera quality is good enough but sound quality not.
2 speaker sound is loud and clear
Some one has commented on flipkart that it is like old nokia VGA type camera  but it is not the truth  camera quality is very good for both rear   front camera.
 this mobile phone 10 month back i Purchased but not working  product quality also not good 
Have not made any calls using the carrier but made a call using WhatsApp and the quality was good enough
Sound also not good.
The picture quality is not good.
8  Dolby atmos surround system really works  it revolutionizes the ordinary sound .
also Camera quality is not good.
i  Sound is low in headphone.
video quality is amazing n camera performance is too good.
Dual SIM 4G not there   it hardly matters though   we dont get a good 3G quality yet   One sim 4G is a good option   the other is 2G only   so it is best thought of in the indian context   But both sim 3G support would have been appreciated  
Head set provided with the box is mediocre   better use some other good quality headsets from renowned brand.
I bought Mobile on 5 May   but from inception it seems problem with Touch and Sound is also not high  if u want to play.
But for sure the accessories are not good looking   they are like very low quality which are available on footpaths.
The Dolby atmos sound is felt only while using headphones otherwise a normal shitty sound.
sound quality is not excellen but very good.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad performance  -32
However i am extremely disappointed with its performance.
Display  battery life and overall performance is very good.
very poor performance of back camera  and front is average or above average.
LOW performance.
 This mobile is very poor in performance.
Overall performance is satisfactory.
Octa core processor with 2GB RAM has faster performance.
This phone is a monster in terms of overall performance and is powered by 1.
If you want raw performance go for it .
So to get optimum output in overall performance one need to know how to customize the phone according to their requirement  this phone is highly customizable .
After 6 month its performance is as good as earlier.
7. battery performance is too good it provided you full day backup.
True Octa Core Processor makes the performance real smooth.
But lets not expect such a high performance at Rs 9000 .
 i am using this phone from last 20 days and its giving awesome performance but only the thing is its mentioned primary camera is 8mp but i dont thing so  not much clearity than samsung   and the headphone very bad other than phone is really good for this price.
It stands in the same performance category as of Mi4 and Zenfone 2.
Very poor performance.
PERFORMANCE is not satisfactory
al other features are just good very smooth ui and lag free performance.
 Camera is average but still works okay  good performance  battery life is good too for although internal memory is bit less but its still good for a phone at this price.
video quality is amazing n camera performance is too good.
dear all let me tell u phone is superb performance wise but it has poorest sound quality in headfone and even we cant hear properly the songs  
 performance is ultimate no lag
The only drawback which i fell is its camera performance other than that it is great to use.
2. the handset will not get hang while operating high performance.
And for flawless performance of phone you d have to format the phone every once in a while   3 months   
somewhere camera performance is not too good but it will not disappoint you .
Barring these 2 things the overall performance of the handset is great.
So to get optimum output in overall performance 
offering consistently not good performance throughout review shown.
Camera performance very poor.great performance  76
excellent performance   
Good performance
Overall performance is satisfactory.
It is very light and very nice performance aswell.
Great performance But .
But lets not expect such a high performance at Rs 9000 .
760 MP2 GPU which is exceptionally outstanding gives a performance you can t even imagine.
5 GHz processor  very good performance 
2 Performance is just awesome.
Display  battery life and overall performance is very good.
No lagging smooth performance with 2GB RAM.
very worst camera that i have ever experienced  after all the phone performance is f9  but in the camera point of view it is so irritating  we can say u cant imangine how it is cheap.
Amazing performance  one thing which disappoint is low internal memory that should be increased at least 16 gb and should have protective gorilla glass protection on screen.
I have been using lenovo a7000 for the past 3 months and I am quite satisfied with its performance.
Great performance.
its performance on earphone is ot that much good.
EDIT  Now after using it for 5months  the performance is great  have already installed 3gb worth of games itself  Multitasking with it is great fun  absolutely addicted to reading ebooks on it.

after using 6 months  I am writing this review phone is very ruff and tuff built quality and high end battery backup  it s most valuable feature  and big screen with good performance.
Awesome performance  With apps  high end games  browsing  etc

Performance is very good in all area.
Performance is good
Phone performance is awesome   just the problem is the lack of 16 gb internal   gorilla glass protection other wise the phone is the best phone in this price range 
Mind it Yureka has higher specs but Antu benchmarking  evaluates overall performance  is highest for Lenevo A7000  its more than Mi4 yureka and many high end phones.
Regarding heating problem  any high end phone should have a little heating problem due to its high performance.
Good performance phone for gaming and multitasking.
 excellent performance.
No lagging or overheating issue like said in the reviews and quite good performance while playing asphalt airborne even for hours.
It has the highest performance in Nenamark 2 with 63.
Performance is very very good.
Other than that it s solid phone with very impressive performance.
Performance was good and exceeds my expectations.
OK OK performance  does overheat quite a lot  sometimes so much that you get conscious about it s heating during talking on phone

worst mobile  -44
Why i am telling that Lenovo A7000 is worst mobile in the current market.
So you will run into this error frequently  insufficient device memory  while updating existing installing new apps 
6  The quality of headphone is poor.
It s because of FLIPKART  I will be stuck with this poor handset.
Low headphone volume  
The front camera especially uses some weird algorythms to make your skin tone look Michael Jackson fair   The rear camera is also a bad device
The product is good and i am quite happy with this product.
used this product from last 10 days and there is no problem in product also the battery is good so if you want to buy go for it.
I did game on this handset though as that does not fall under my usage routine  I tested this device with Mortal kombat X  and Injustice gods the results are amazing.
So If you want high battery back up you should buy power bank or other device.
Headphone is not at all good.
I would say the heating reported by some people does not hold true for the handset I am using.
i have requested flipkart to replace me with a new handset  let us see how things go.
You will have to purchase new headphone to experience Dolby Atmos sound.
However  the same was promptly replaced with a new handset by Flipkart.
 Perfect device in such low price.
I have been using this device since last 3.
i have purchase the lenova A7000 on 29 april 2015 but the mobile volume is not working and key pad is also not working as i called the customer care for the return the product they are not ready to give me the refund money they are giving reasons and not ready to replace so i suggest not to buy any item from flipkart as the worst service i had .
 handset is good but the accessories are not good looking like very low quality .
with two days of use i wold say the handset seems to be fluidic and to be more specific
It is better to say that the headphone is not good at all.
Overall  GOOD product considering the price.
The volume is also very low when using headphone.
on feel on any other device and buy it.
4  Most of the users said the device heats too much.
Overall good product at this price range.
headphone is not worth it 
overall an average quality product but the price at which i bought it  8098  this is pretty good  
For me this is my last product and I recommend my friends to buy in the open market or stores better than this online.
Truely saying headphone is not good enough for music lovers.
Super fast phone but headphone is worst 
Please dont buy this mobile Lenovo A7000  its a china local product.
But as is common in the tech world  every time there is a new device  everybody drools over it and very soon it becomes old and nobody follows up.
I am using it for 2 months and UI VIBE is bad bad bad   Set is awesome   Back camera is bad   Truly bad   Front camera is good   Overall you can buy in this price   But now k3 note is available so don t ever buy this product on the place of k3   
I previous device was Zenfone 6 and believe me ZenUI is simply brilliant.
so please dont buy this product.
9. camera quality is fine in auto mode but in HDR mode you need to be extra careful while holding steady the device.
Overall it s a good product from flip kart awesome mobile  73
There are much better handset now at this range.
Now enable atmos and check sound with a good headphone  it works great   
I am using Lenovo A7000 mobile since 6 months  Mobile is good in quality.
The product is good and value for money.
 i am using this phone from last 20 days and its giving awesome performance but only the thing is its mentioned primary camera is 8mp but i dont thing so  not much clearity than samsung   and the headphone very bad other than phone is really good for this price.
It is very good product in this range but the touch got damaged within 3 months.
Good product no issues with the device.
 This is a good product for this budget.
 Awesome camera super battery backup and light weight low priceee good product i suggested to my friends go for lenovo a7000.
The product is good and i am quite happy with this product.
over all good product.
It is a good product at the end of the day.
Lenevo has emerged in the market with good product.
The product initially appeared good but started showing signs of trouble in 40 days.
 Good product   light weight .
Today i have received their newly launched mobile Lenovo A7000 where i found that only one Sim is LTE and other sim only support 2 G. i have intiated the refund for my hard money as they are cheating consumers like us .
otherwise that handset is good looking good   screen size is 5.
This happens and is very evident when you have use device encryption.
Its a very good product.
If you are looking for a good device in a budget of Rs.
It s a very good product from lenovo.
I orderd Lenovo A7000 mobile via Flipkart.
it is very good product and satisfied with it and using for over 9 months 
 good product lenova A7000 4g smart phone it works fast  good video clarity net speed and big screen It s always better

 Excellent product Good quality images sound performance  cheap business gadget.
i bought new mobile lenovo a7000  it works like a heater  when did i complain the CC said this is the mobile how is built due to heavy processor.
Good Handset with a good price.
I have been using this device for over six months and the device is simply superb.
I will stress that it is not too low but it is low in comparison to other phones and I have seen a few reviewers complaing about the low headphone output so I am sure that I am not the only one.
very very good handset or realy performance beaty cameras or stylis slim shekh 
Overall it s a good product from flip kart 
 pathetic product please never buy this product .
 It has been a day since i have been using this phone and believe me it is an amazing device.
A very good product at this price.
It is very good product in this range.
handsfree were useless  so better buy some good headphone
GOOD PRODUCT FOR LESS PRICE WHO OPT MUST CHOOSE LENEVO 7000 ONLY 
I had a heating problem with my ipad4 that I bought from Amazon and they were very prompt in replacing the device.
Nice one Product was delivered fast worth buying under 10 k. corns   Sound and pic Quality 
Great Product with Good Spects
its a good device .
 Good product  Value for money  i recommended this product  i am satisfy with this product  thanks flipkart.
Overall good product at this price range.
Its the same scene with the second device as well.
Overall a nice handset but would have desired 16 gigs of storage with 13mp shooter.
i m first time purchasing in mobile lenovo a7000 from flipkart side.
 Very good product i loved it best price and good features really good 
over all a very good handset in this price.
Not to buy Lenovo Product  all are dumb  even my previous handset was dumb  and i had to sell at low price to other buyer.
Barring these 2 things the overall performance of the handset is great.
Good product and good service by flipkart.
GOOD PRODUCT FOR LESS PRICE ROM SHOULD BE 32 GB
overall an average quality product but the price at which i bought it  8098  this is pretty good  
product is good.
So concluding it all it is a brilliant device with some little drawbacks
If if this issue is not there then overall product is good acc to the price.
9. camera quality is fine in auto mode but in HDR mode you need to be extra careful while holding steady the device.
I purchased lenovo a7000 and using it from more than 5 month in this mobile their is connectivity problem in wifi hotspot otherwise its very good mobile 
5  Headphone provided is too cheap.
Use some other good headphone.
Heating issue  I did not play any games on the mobile but I checked for heating after browsing the internet on 4G for an hour and the handset had become warm around the camera area.
 1 youtube is not working properly and shows error but in other device with same wifi same video will work good
guys its ur luck that u got the good handset else u can also get the defective pice.
 Good product.
 According to price handset is good but lacks Corning Gorilla Glass  Camera app sometimes freezes.

7  Build quality is poor
Low Quality of Head Phones

So  this is a new way of cheating people by selling cheap quality mobiles any saying that it is damaged due to customer negligence.
Back panel is of very cheap quality too.
sound quality was too bad  too low.
Poor sound quality cheapest material Front camera is similar to 2 mp.
Therefore they are selling cheap quality phones virtually without any warranty.

2  Cheap thin plastic back cover  very dissappointed  not from you Lenovo 
Headphones are not the noise cancellation ones but ok quality  figured out the low vol was due to adjustments required in the Dolby Atmos equalizer  .
The phone is nice but sound quality is very low.
Its a nice phone if we are talking about features but it will disappoint you in terms of quality sound quality is good but speaker is moody touch screen will create problem very soon after buying it charger is also of low quality.

I hade spent 9000 but this model is useless and of low quality.
The back cover is very thin and seems to be made of low quality plastic.
But for sure the accessories are not good looking   they are like very low quality which are available on footpaths.
camera quality is low  especially PC.

Out of the box user memory available would be around 3.
internal memory is insufficient
internal memory is low but.
Although u need extra memory for saving data but pre.
The FM strength is not good and it switch up automatically after some time if we have low memory .  
5GB user memory available out of 8GB.
If you have a budget constrains then go for this phone or else increase your budget and go for at least 16GB internal memory others Lenovo phones.
price is ok. internal memory not sufficient 
1  Only 8 gb internal memory and out of that only 4 gb is available.
It has 16 gb internal memory  full HD 1080p resolution   13mp camera.
4 no lagging and some apps can be moved to sd card  also default storage will change whats app  and any other download directly to external memory card
2  Memory  As the internal memory is just 8GB which is maximum occupied by phone software and default apps.
8. internal memory is only 3.
 I have a brought this product and it is looking good  working well  internal memory was less and picture quality is low  8GB  after I brought this Lenovo have released within less than a month with 16GB version mobile with better features.
almost always the phone memory gets full.
But  the internal memory could have been given as 16 GB with same price or may be with Rs.
5 GB internal memory after excluding all apps.
The biggest limitation is only 8 GB of internal memory  it s actually  6GB  and the user gets hardly 3.
Memory is very low.
8GB internal memory is not enough and most of the apps cannot be installed in sd card.
8 GB internal memory .
its value 4 money but due to its 8 gb of intrnl memory.
Available memory is 2.
The expandable memory up to 32 GB is only for data storage  you will not be able to move any applications to data card so if you are using large applications  soon you will be out of memory space.
only one thing  regarding internal memory comes up with 8GB  in this nly 3GB available for user  if lenovo a7000 will give 16gb internal  then its become good  why because android 5.
Lollipop with Vibe UI have great memory management.
 Camera is average but still works okay  good performance  battery life is good too for although internal memory is bit less but its still good for a phone at this price.
Apps can be installed totally in internal or external memory.
1 GB is always accupied  may be due to Android Lollypop which also accupies most of internal memory of 8GB 
So good feature but internal memory only 8 gb so I prefer same feature with 16 gb memory fone on lenovo other model 
You are unable to download more apps as you get the warning  view phone storage inspite of the fact that you have external memory as well   you have set the download settings to card memory.
b  8 GB internal memory
5 GB internal memory.
we can understand this is a budget oriented device bt still now a days at this price point u will atleast can expect decent built quality  16gb internal memory  13mp camera  with display protection  led notification  backlit led capacitive button.
And internal memory is just 8 GB  user space .
3  8 GB ROM is quite enough as u have expandable memory of 32 GB.
but need more internal memory.
After few applications and updates the internal memory gets full and many applications like fb  google packages  etc you cant move to external card.
But the internal memory is very low.

8GB of internal memory is for average users not for heavy users.
They say ki memory is expandable only by 32gb.
It can download all the apps from teh App store but the same are installed on internal memory and cannot be transfered to Sd card.
But the internal memory is only 8GB.
10 medium memory consuming apps can be shuffled without any problems .
some times overheating when i play the high memory games that s the only problem to say.
4. internal memory  ROM  8GB witch is available 1.
1  Enough memory for alive Apps.
itna bhari bhi nahi hota memory cards if you noticed.
Amazing performance  one thing which disappoint is low internal memory that should be increased at least 16 gb and should have protective gorilla glass protection on screen.
8GB internal memory is quite low and gets exhausted soon  
Main draw back is internal memory.
May be this will help to keep some internal memory available.
3. internal memory is quite small.
though sometime it freezes while working only when phone memory is full.
The internal memory is 8GB  for our use its only around 3.
2  8 GB internal memory.
It adds some very effective memory management features to the release.
only cons is available memory is 2gb for user so had to delete some app and need to buy a memory card for it.
It would also have been great if the inbuilt memory had been 16gb instead of just 8 gb  the A6000 Plus has 16 gb  
--------------------------------------------------------
bad quality  -50
build quality is also very bad.
CONS  Back cover is prone to smudges  caught it after few touching  most of the time having problem in taking out the battery  almost 5 GB internal storage  out of 8 GB  is consumed at the initial level itself  had to buy micro sd card    asphalt game hangs miserably finally uninstalled it  screen guard  received with the set  contained many small bubbles when applied on the screen  music volume is on the lower side  should be increased  ear phone is of poor quality.

13mp Camera is low quality.
Back panel is of very cheap quality too.
sound quality was too bad  too low.
the screen guard that comes with the box is not of good quality  better to buy one from outside and the headphone looks very cheap  white color .
Therefore they are selling cheap quality phones virtually without any warranty.
 I have a brought this product and it is looking good  working well  internal memory was less and picture quality is low  8GB  after I brought this Lenovo have released within less than a month with 16GB version mobile with better features.

1. very cheap built quality along with its accessories
So  this is a new way of cheating people by selling cheap quality mobiles any saying that it is damaged due to customer negligence.

Speaker is just awesome  but change the headsets which come along with the phone as they are of cheap quality.
2  Cheap thin plastic back cover  very dissappointed  not from you Lenovo 
The back cover is very thin and seems to be made of low quality plastic.
But for sure the accessories are not good looking   they are like very low quality which are available on footpaths.

Sound quality is low in company provided headphones if we use another headphones then sound quality is loud and clear.
5 build quality is good
very very low quality camera if someone compare it with 3rd grade intex mobiles the intex wins  very very low quality camera lenova is cheating in the name of 5 and 8 MP camera but in real  the front is of 2 MP and rear is of 1 MP quality  photo blunt over 25 cm  and also on the voice is not very good as per the Dolby atom.
Purchased in first sale and using from last one week  its a nice phone as good hardware performance and better build quality good battery backup  nice display and viewing angle.
1. sound quality and headphone are very low quality.
 handset is good but the accessories are not good looking like very low quality .
Camera quality is ok but after clicking the picture the brightness will seems very low in the pictures.
Let me clear this out the headphone is definitely cheap quality but most of the brands Xiaomi Huawei  Motorola etc  they do not ever bother to provide a headphone but atleast Lenovo did.
Build quality is good too.
ear piece is low quality but nevermind
The phone is nice but sound quality is very low.
i didnt use that headphone that comes in the box  really its of cheap quality.
Its a nice phone if we are talking about features but it will disappoint you in terms of quality sound quality is good but speaker is moody touch screen will create problem very soon after buying it charger is also of low quality.
The Back is made of very cheap quality material can break any time if not handled with care.
Build Quality is good
1 The build quality is good and the overall phone weight is very light.
camera not good but ok. back panel are very low quality and also earphone is to bad.
Ear phones are of cheap quality  but with this price range it is not surprising. 
dolby atmos has nothing to do with sound qualiry as you wouldnt like sound in headfone too low and lowest quality headphone given 
But for sure the accessories are not good looking   they are like very low quality which are available on footpaths.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad_speaker  -23
Screwed up loud speaker.
But One problem that I m facing is the Loud speaker prblm.
ear phones speakers and call speaker are very low.
Loud speaker was dead after few days of above problem.
Extremely muffled speaker volume   but not a very big let down 
When Play music without ear piece or put the call in loud speaker mode  back part is vibrating  
Speaker is pretty  loud and crisp  I would definitely give a good rating for that.
The volume is low to hear music on loud speaker.
loud speaker volume is very minimum 
 Low ear piece   speaker volume.
6  Speakers sound quality is good  they should have provided front speaker 
Delivery was prompt  but that s where the fun stops  I got a phone with a defective speaker  flipkart exchanged it.
external speaker is of poor quality.
the loud speaker sound is little low.
it should have good speaker they have only provided one speaker at the back but Dolby Atmos is superb if you are using premium headphones  stock headphone quality is not that good you have to buy good head phones to enjoy Dolby Atmos feature.
Its a nice phone if we are talking about features but it will disappoint you in terms of quality sound quality is good but speaker is moody touch screen will create problem very soon after buying it charger is also of low quality.
3. really good speaker partially because my previous phone had very bad speaker 
Speaker is too good if and only if u download some good apps to listen songs like VLC App  Music Player App  Video App alngwith using Dolby Atmos.
 hats off flipkart delivery service  i received with in 20hr  owesome speaker sound  back camera is better than yureka  front camera is average to compare yureka  only having 3.
can anyone imagine  Dolby Atmos  with single speaker and speaker is also at the back side.
However  the reduction of the number of speakers  A7000 has only a  single  speaker while the A6000 has  TWO  is a little disheartening   
--------------------------------------------------------
heating issue  -21
 I am very dissatisfied with heating issue.
There is a small problem of heating when the 3G 4G is used for a long time.
Regarding heating problem  any high end phone should have a little heating problem due to its high performance.
the gaming performance is very good and lag free even at high graphics games like asphalt 8 goes on butter smooth and there might be a little heating issue with u can resolve by clearing app and offing wifi.
Don t know what other issues might turn up.
i was feared to buy this phone as most of its reviews mentioned its heating issue but its not that much.
Though the specifications are great to read  there are major issues which the description does not clarify and you will be stuck with this phone  
 it has accessibility to big games and unkown apps had great battery power but still to improve and the problem is Heating not as much as high 
I got this phone 21st may and i am getting problem of heating problem and when i play the music it automatically muting in this handset.
Its having severe heating issue while charging   using GPS   using LTE 4G.
Lenovo A7000 seems to have a heating problem and from the feedback I m seeing around  it s a common problem with the phone.
No heating while using or charging  I have seen many good brands having such issues 
The phone does not seem to have any major heating issues as well and manages to keep itself cool even after a good 35 mins of continuous talking.
On a Normal day to day basis I am not coming across any heating issue.
10. no heating problem it is common to get quite heated when high end games are played 
In a span of four months this phone was serviced twice for various issues  and each service took 1month .
that handset working awesome when i got but after that there is some issue starting when i start to operate that handset getting hangged   heating also but after that when i stop using that handset being normal that issue was resolved but there is major issue in that handset is left side touch is not working   when i restart that mobile 3.
No major heating issues noticed apart from normal heating.
i had battery problem issues with this mobile but no one is active here i better say not to buy.
--------------------------------------------------------
storage  16
card from internal storage.
 8gb rom is just not sufficient for internal storage.
Available storage is 3.
5 gb internal storage  lowlight dual flash is taking gud pic to compare yureka alcatel  headset totally waste  i never seen before this like type of low quality android mobile headset  i throw it to basket  touch   gaming perfomens is great  battery perfomens is also gud  and two times i faced restarting problem  lightly heated when i played mostwanted 15min  if you guys like to hearing song with headset you not like this mobile 
Though the internal storage is low   expandable storage solves the issue   install apps on the SD card with the lollipop pdate is much simpler 
The phone comes with an internal storage of 8 GB.
4 no lagging and some apps can be moved to sd card  also default storage will change whats app  and any other download directly to external memory card
Only Miss is the 16gb storage of others in place of its 8gb and its 1.
 excelent mobile but internal storage is low and
  11 exapndable storage
but i have got only 4 gb internal storage 
But 8 GB storage is little less.
I have SD card but still there are many apps that cannot be installed on external storage  unless rooted .
We can store apps in the external SD card as it has only 8 GB of internal Storage.
You can check the draw back by installing the APP MGR III or disk usage   storage analyser  
flip kart can offer a free 1 tb storage drive but if once we place the order flipkart says We regret to inform you that the offer for 1 year office365 free subscription and 1TB storage was not available on Lenovo A7000  Due to some technical error it was displayed on the product page.
5 GB storage is available for use in total 8 GB   it won t allow you to download even watz app from play store if you don t have an external memory.
internal storage is also good.
I request Lenovo developers designers  Please do not split the internal storage into usb and phone memory.
5 Gb but knew before buying about the internal storage so it s ok. 3. back.
6. apps not transfer to external storage.
There is lot of discussion on the internal storage.
I faced issue with internal storage  over heating and hanging.
internal storage filled by updates.
--------------------------------------------------------
dolby atmos feature  16
 7. sound is low but with dolby it is good .
Now enable atmos and check sound with a good headphone  it works great   
 It is true that Dolby atmos is worth  it will change any media play like you tube soundcloud etc.
DOLBY ATMOS is simply awesome.
Screen resolution is great and the Dolby Atmos feature sounds great through a decent set of headphones.
it should have good speaker they have only provided one speaker at the back but Dolby Atmos is superb if you are using premium headphones  stock headphone quality is not that good you have to buy good head phones to enjoy Dolby Atmos feature.
Dolby Atmos is good  only via headphones  but since the sound engine produces so little sound that its impact can t be felt much.
Dolby sound provision is there but it is not up to the mark.
Thirdly coming to DOLBY ATMOS feature   it worked good with my Sony XB headphones.
Sound quality is not so great and even the so called ATMOS dolby is useless.
But again you need to hear same song on a Dolby atmos phone   a non dolby phone to understand the difference.
I bought A7000 because of Dolby Atmos   dual sim   bigger battery   lenovo brand  expecting fast updates and bug fixes  
Dolby Atmos which is its star feature isn t that outstanding as it was meant to be.
Audio quality even without Dolby enabled is good.
Dolby Atmos is really awesome .
Dolby atmos is extremely good.
SOUND is just average dolby atoms doesn t seem to do much
Dolby Atmos at its best in good earphone 
I have personally experienced some true Dolby sound.
Dolby Atmos very very important 
The dolby ATMOS is a new feature  but however you really need good source of music or movies with the atmos sound to experience it in the earphone  otherwise it acts like just another equalizer.
You need to buy this phone with the latest Dolby Atmos technology  if you are a music listener then you are going to get blown away with dolby atmos on  provided you have a better head phones.
Not able to get any ATMOS encoded audio files.
Only drawback is  there is no option to save presets with the tweaked Dolby settings.
I received 3 updates till the time I am writing the review and it is recommended to update asap coz after first update Dolby was not functioning properly  but with second update it was booming.
Dolby atmos is amazing and is the only USP of the phone.
Dolby ATMOS feature is excellent 10 10 
Dolby Atmos is good but setting equalizer is little painful .
Dolby Atmos is good.
3  Dolby Atmos is great if you really know how to use it
Also the speaker is on back side and when I was watching HD video on youtube Display quality was awsome but was not able to hear sounds clearly even when volume was set to full but again use dolby app to enhance the sound quality.
--------------------------------------------------------
high end games  14
end games available in playstore.
can play high end games.
5. with 2gb ram  multitasking is good and can play high end games with good graphics but sometimes processing is slow.
only cons  it heatup in long call and high speed games due to octacore processor.
i have used high end mobiles iphone5s  one plus one moto turbo .
I would prefer to get a shockproof screenguard instead of tempered glass as it is stronger n costs aroud 200 onlyNOTE  i heard alot about heating issue but i faced it only once for 5 minutes while i was using it for the first tym bt aftr that i played games for around 4.
while using this phone in 4G mode  and playing high graphic games  temperature rise too high.
6  2 GB RAM is a must for this device because of playing high end games since it has an octa core processor.
Mind it Yureka has higher specs but Antu benchmarking  evaluates overall performance  is highest for Lenevo A7000  its more than Mi4 yureka and many high end phones.
 In this phone we get 2 GB ram which allow heavy games to operate without hang.
All games are playable.
I have downloaded the ASPHALT 8 games and is excellent.
Games are going fantastic   high end graphics games are also playable GTA  MC X  etc 
game lover should go for it because the asphlat 8 N. O. V. A etc these heavy games runs by processor without even a single lag.
Games are so smooth
Installed some high end graphic games to check with music running along side and there was no lag or skip.
10. no heating problem it is common to get quite heated when high end games are played 
3 Performance  the octa core processor performs very well even with heavy games like asphalt 8 and modern combat 4.
i have not checked playing games on it but i think as per its specs it would run smoother.
so not good for playing games also.
Vil update aftr trying heavy games 
Phone gets heated up while playing heavy games or 3G data while charging.
Games are so smooth.
3gb usable due to a bunch of pre installed apps already on the phone including games social networking and other google apps.
So you cannot have high end games which will accupy space and there by slowing down the phone.
Octa core Processor handles easily the stuffs and performance is par with high end phones.
after using 6 months  I am writing this review phone is very ruff and tuff built quality and high end battery backup  it s most valuable feature  and big screen with good performance.
Awesome performance  With apps  high end games  browsing  etc 
Heating issue  I did not play any games on the mobile but I checked for heating after browsing the internet on 4G for an hour and the handset had become warm around the camera area.
2  In the Antu benchmark this phone scores more than 43000  which is much higher than many high end   high budget phone priced over Rs.
heavy games can be played easily.
However I have not played any heavy games so far.
I am an average user who does mostly browsing and playing games sometimes.
Does not work like budget phone but like high end.
at time of playg games .
No heating even while playing heavy games.
Look resembles some high end phone.
Not tried playing games on it yet.
I do not play heavy games so cant comment on that.
My phone is not getting any heating problems  lucky me  and i have played all kind of heavy games on my phone.
This feature is provided in only high end Samsung phones above Note 3.
I adjusted the Equalizer and heard the songs  saw videos  played games .
maybe since I m new to games  am exaggerating.
Pros light weight mobile can handle high end games value for money.
Regarding heating problem  any high end phone should have a little heating problem due to its high performance.
3 games are really good
The games apps run too easy compared to other phones in the same segment.
an awesome budget phone with all the features packed in it with an power full punch and its front camera is brilliantly aewsome and back camera is not so it s processor make us to play games with high end graphics like deer hunt and many more games it gives us very speed with its 2 gb of ram i suggest you to buy this product 
Large Display with bright colours Fine processing speed   GPU Check with playing high end games   
 can run almost any high end game that android got.
 Good phone  good for browsing  good for games  good for apps  latest Android  Light weight is good 
3 gb which is good for playing any heavy games as i tried asphalt 8 which did not lag .
It just cant provide that dynamic range due to lack of dedicated hardware  which these higher end earphones demand.
Heats up when heavy games are played 
--------------------------------------------------------
octa core processor  14
 With a big screen  meaty battery and powerful processor  the A7000 ticks all the right boxes for a smartphone.
Absolute Masterpiece   Best Price  Features Android Lollipop with 2 GB RAM and best Processor Speed.
True octacore processor  works on all 8 cores even while operating whatsapp  thus using battery.
Touch  Sound quality  Processor  various sensors  features are the plus points.
system  with 2 GB RAM and decent processor.
Touch is very responsive and while using a7000 I felt it has really good processor and graphics processor.
True Octa Core Processor makes the performance real smooth.
only gud thing is frnt cam  good processor   vibrant display .
The phone comes with mediatek processor which is good but the which charging it takes more time as compared with qualcomm snapdragon which charges very quickly as compared to media tech processor .
Processor is fast and lcd screen has good quality.
The mediatek CPU are really good with true octa core performance  as compared to its peers having a Snapdragon 615   which has a better rating   Mediatek are cheaper alternative thats were cost savings happens.
i bought new mobile lenovo a7000  it works like a heater  when did i complain the CC said this is the mobile how is built due to heavy processor.
5 ghz octa core doesnt make u feel u r lagging at all.
9  Pretty good processor MediaTek MT6752m 64.
Processor is super fast.
Ram   Processor are good.
True8core processor is awesome.
The processor is too fast for such a money.
--------------------------------------------------------
next day  -13
When I called the support team back  I was told that the call can only be scheduled for the next day.
Then I had to make a new request for return and they send me an automated email for calling me the next day and when they called today for whatever reason they could not hear me so send in a message that they will now call the next day  this is really disappointing.

Next day another technician called and checked the mobile  he said mobile is fine  even though I was telling him the problem  he was not ready to accept.

Ordered the product on flipkart and to my surprise  got this delivered the next day.

booked it on 22nd and as usual flipkart mates delivered it on the next day.
There is a reason behind that they dont want you to give chance to cancel the order so seems it was preplanned that they will deliver it next day early morning.
There is no actual support  I made a return request they called the next day and immediately send an email message that the request for return is rejected.
Flipkart Delivery  5 stars  received phone in the morning around 10 00 am in very next day.

8 gb  11
b  8 GB internal memory
It has only 8 GB internal from that major part approx.
8 GB internal memory .
CONS  Back cover is prone to smudges  caught it after few touching  most of the time having problem in taking out the battery  almost 5 GB internal storage  out of 8 GB  is consumed at the initial level itself  had to buy micro sd card    asphalt game hangs miserably finally uninstalled it  screen guard  received with the set  contained many small bubbles when applied on the screen  music volume is on the lower side  should be increased  ear phone is of poor quality.
Low Internal Storage at 8 GB   makes it mandatory for you to purchase a extra micro SD card of at least 16 GB   i got a Samsung micro sdhc class 10   extra 500 and 16 GB OTG Pen drive 
Internal storage is 8 gb but users get only slightly over 3 gb usable space.
1  Only 8 gb internal memory and out of that only 4 gb is available.
It has 16 gb internal memory  full HD 1080p resolution   13mp camera.
3 gb which is good for playing any heavy games as i tried asphalt 8 which did not lag .
2GB good  but internal only 8 GB   wish it would be 16GB.
2  8 GB internal memory.
With only 8 GB you will be able to install a handful of apps and after some 5 months  you will run out of space for apps.
--------------------------------------------------------
of touch screen  11
Good touch screen.
I purchased the Lenovo A7000 from Flipkart and the phone which I recieved has a problem in the touch screen sensor.
My half of the touch screen is not working.
Tap to light  double click vol key to capture photo without turning on camera  wide touch  swipe bottom screen to light.
The right hand half side of the touch screen is not working just after 3 months of buying and also am facing a bad customer service experience as well.
The phone was okay  but the problem was with the touch screen which was dead and not responsive.
The touch screen is good enough and watching videos on this mobile is a delight.
Again for first 3 weeks I was happy with the functionality of the product  but after exactly 34 days a little water seeped in the mobile  thus making the touch screen dead.
But what i feel now touch screen is not responding very well in both the phones.
But Overall I found the phone very easy to use vibrant colors very good touch screen.
Touch screen and battery was great initially but now after 8 months both has gone below the standard Battery is still better than samsung s duos which I had used before .
But soon the touch screen started becoming unresponsive.
Intially I was pretty happy with the Product and loved it  but this was short lived  as the touch screen stopped working I had a hard time in deleting all data and images.
After 15 days of using touch screen problem will come and one by one whole touch wont work.
Touch screen and buttons were not working with in 6 months time  
Screen  touch  battery backup  music  video  game  app  no heating problem  etc etc are good.
Seems like all A7000s have a touch screen problem 1st unit lower left screen became insensitive to touch within a week.
To change the touch screen issues  they need a week time.
Touch Screen is took some time to respond  software need further polished  else it s fine.
 after 6 months of buying lower half of touch screen is not working.
In a couple of days after buying it  the touch screen became unresponsive.
Barely three months later the right side of the touch screen stopped.
be ready for defect in touch screen.
very good screen and touch sense are pretty good.
 worst mobile   screen touch stop working   replaced by service centre .
Al of sudden few spots in the touch screen stop responding  but thank as it was under warranty and get it repaired.
dont purchase this phone it is not good touch screen is very bad dont purchase its is BAKWAS.
every time they just replaced the touch screen and returned it after 10 days  and again I am facing the same issue in 10 days.
Its a nice phone if we are talking about features but it will disappoint you in terms of quality sound quality is good but speaker is moody touch screen will create problem very soon after buying it charger is also of low quality.
Touch Screen sensitivity is good.
30 days to replace the touch screen as they have to order the touch screen from china and they don t have it readily available  for a single button also they will order it from china only after you handover the handset to them to have it fixed.
First it was few touch points  soon the area grew and finally the whole touch screen became unresponsive.
lot many problems because of touch screen fault.
Bugs with Notification area  it will freezes touch screen and volume buttons.
It is not been a week that my half of the touch screen is not working.
Touch screen is not working.
To start with touch screen  at times goes crazy and even though we punch with our finger hand it would not move ahead.
The touch is super smooth and the screen is very receptive  which is good.
3. good touch screen video quality etc 
touch screen malfunctioned within a month of purchase took to service station and got repaired.
Touch screen s partial paralysis  huh.
Here atthe service center  I got a SHOCK of my life  the problem that had occured was not covered under warranty and after arguing I was will to pay for the touch screen repair  which was Quoted at 14622  .

with lenovo a7000  9
Seamless working and happy with Lenovo A7000 
 i got a defective lenovo a7000 handset .
The earphones have been rendered absolute obselete  i think the entire lenovo A7000 first batch sold on flipkart is a defective batch  maybe others also might react by sending mails to you people.
planning to buy an non lenovo plugs sold out side and see if this phone can survive the non lenovo prescribed charging units   The plug and wire should be immediately redesigned and supplied to the customers before any phone is sold next thanks 
My request to Lenovo is that please look into camera quality.
device A7000 look good from edges   light weight also.
 The lenovo a7000 is great .
So good feature but internal memory only 8 gb so I prefer same feature with 16 gb memory fone on lenovo other model 
Why i am telling that Lenovo A7000 is worst mobile in the current market.
its better than any other models of Lenovo available today in market.
I didnt expect such mobile from Lenovo.
2. very easy to use and good lenovo UI
Very Happy and excited to receive Lenovo A7000.
Previous A7000 had issues and caused severe headache for just 2 .
Camera has panorama mode  smile nd face shutter  nd various other lenovo enhancements.
Regarding Lenova A7000 mobile  performance   battery backup is superb.
I bought a white Lenovo A7000 mobile.
But i dont have any cellphone to use that s why i order a new mobile Lenovo A6000 Plus White.
so i reffer to my all friends buy this lenovo products 
12 Lenovo awesome Support network   keeps you safe that any issue you would get a quick solution unlike Micromax  
When i take mobile to Service center they told me mobile display is dead so i am not recommended Lenovo mobile to anyone.
Correct me if I m wrong but I always thought Lenovo had their name printed in the front right under the ear piece  but the one I got had their name written on the back.
I orderd Lenovo A7000 mobile via Flipkart.
lenovo a 7000 worst ever build .
Today i have received their newly launched mobile Lenovo A7000 where i found that only one Sim is LTE and other sim only support 2 G. i have intiated the refund for my hard money as they are cheating consumers like us .
i bought new mobile lenovo a7000  it works like a heater  when did i complain the CC said this is the mobile how is built due to heavy processor.
Good lenovo is taking care of its customers.
as usual lenovo A.
Few awesome Lenovo features will surprise you  nd i wont break the surprise.
i have purchase a leneovo A7000 mobile date on 14 August  2015 2 19 PM and my order receive in 21 August 2015 
  I ALWAYS HAPPY WITH FLIPKART BUT THIS TIME I CAN SAY VERY POOR SERVICE THEY ARE GIVING AS MY THIS LENOVO A7000 PURCHASE.
Tested Camera quality with my friend s Moto X 1st gen  ROFL my Lenovo A7000 is far better than that.
 These are the problems i have faced in my new lenovo a7000.
Not at all satisfied with Lenovo A7000.
Please dont buy this mobile Lenovo A7000  its a china local product.
flip kart can offer a free 1 tb storage drive but if once we place the order flipkart says We regret to inform you that the offer for 1 year office365 free subscription and 1TB storage was not available on Lenovo A7000  Due to some technical error it was displayed on the product page.
Lenovo mobile Touch screen is not working.
The features that s are given by Lenovo a7000 is enough  but the phones becomes very hot while charging that you can t touch it.
Battery was responding very good   i put lenovo a7000 under continuous wifi connection  social media  fb wtsapp  youtube usage was heavy  almost 4 hours of the day  for me it lasted for more than 2 days.
I am using this phone from last 7 Months and phone is one of the best phones under 10000 Slot   Everything about phone is excellent   Be it s RAM   Camera and other Specs   Lenovo is best 
now how much a7000 produces under heavy graphics usage will be part of investigation.
i m first time purchasing in mobile lenovo a7000 from flipkart side.
Overall A7000 fulfills my needs and exceeds my expectations so 5 stars.
Overall LENOVO has done a great job  phone is a smartphone   with flipkart app installed  .
You can t restore your previous phone messages because Lenovo is so supreme that it denies any other backup format than its own .
Some smart lenovo features inside make awesome to use.
Searching on the Internet took me to forums where many other Lenovo users had the similar issue.
bought considering camera will be good as lenovo is a big brand name but disappointed to have it now.
very good lenovo VIbe interface.
Lenovo A7000 I am very much satisfied with the product and the deal with u feel as amazing.
Lenovo cant make a nice phone.
do not buy this phone as many others also have this problem with the phone and lenovo is keeping quiet about it 
I personally use a OnePlus One and a Nexus 5 and am amazed how close the A7000 is in performance to these.
Very disappointed with Lenovo a7000.
Lenovo is not ready to replace the phone 
But the Lenovo A7000 looks good.
i am happy with the lenovo mobile product i bought.
Dear Lenovo people  if this entire batch has gone wrong  take some bold steps  
It is very evident that Lenovo phones have network drop issues  Google and find many forum discussion .
--------------------------------------------------------
nice speakers  9
5  The speaker is not loud enough even at full volume.
Speaker is pretty  loud and crisp  I would definitely give a good rating for that.
Speaker is loud and clear but not like few nokia phones i have used before
 Low ear piece   speaker volume.
5 Yes sound is not too louder of speaker and headphone.
Speaker is just awesome  but change the headsets which come along with the phone as they are of cheap quality.
3. really good speaker partially because my previous phone had very bad speaker 
Audio   8 10   Loud speaker is not too loud but it does the job.

experience  8
Not a good experience with lenovo.
I have the worst Touchscreen experience after using A7000.
No OGS solution of Gorilla Glass   Asahi Dragontail   that means you can easily crack the display if not careful   Get a good Tempered glass Branded   if you need some protection   Though i personally dont like anything on the Display   makes the experience very bad
Phone is fine but after using it for 3 months I can say its better to go for some other budgets phone over all experience not satisfactory 
its really great experience.
It s an awesome experience with it.
I had a great experience with Lenovo A7000 since the time I had purchased it.
Music experience was good 
With a decent pair of earphones experiencing the built in Dolby Atmos technology was a superb experience
Amazing experience with Dolby Atmos  Not with the given headphones 
This phone gives you a please experience with the big screen and the sound is awesome.
Not a very pleasant experience.
i had very bad experience with is mobile.
Very bad experience with LenovoA7000.
Great Experience 
this is my personal experience.
 browsing experience is also good 
Overall it has been a positive experience with the device.
It s good experience.
Total nice experience till now.
And worst experience with flipkart this time  they response not good for this product.
This is annoying and pathetic experience when one buys phone after 5 years  
So like to know if the handset i received has any specific issue or is it an overall experience with everyone.
Very bad experience from Lenovo.
Great experience.
 Best Musik Experience We can Get Ever
Have very very bad experience with service provider and they will not even respond to your query.
  better android smart phone  not best        best multimedia experience   fair battery     This is what you need
Believe me its an amazing experience with the display of the phone.
Browsing experience is nice.
Android Lollypop OS  Its a nice experience with more new GUI   features than Kitkat OS.
Happy with the overall experience 
This is very bad experience with Lenovo product second time  after previous bad experience with Lenovo yoga tab.
Video Quality   HD quality video in this phone is a truly priding experience.
used earphone as well but cant experience the well advertised Dolby atmos function of it.
But in practical experience  It is the worst phone  equals RedMi phone in heating .
Overall experience is good.
--------------------------------------------------------

The battery is super awesome and the touch and gestures also looks quite astonishing.
Awesome   good battery.
Awesome sleek rectangular design
Great display Slim   looks good Awesome music quality no lag no heating.
--------------------------------------------------------
in low light  -7
Camera is not good captures grainy images in low light
5 Cameras are decent at this price point however the low light clicks are not so good.
So  taking pictures with flash during lower light conditions is improving the quality somehow but still I don t like it.
Good camera except in low light.
5. front camera is good for taking selfies in moderate low light 
A bit noisy when taken inside on low light.
flash is not working when taking photos at night or low light by using Default camera.
Horrible focusing in low light and grainy picture
Pictures taken during low light are more horrible.
only 1 thing bad about this phone is primary camera suck in low light.
In low light both the cameras are not good.
3. is this a 8mp camera  really  camera produce lots of noise in low light.
But at low light these are pathetic.
4  Camera quality is not good  grainy images in low light.
Low light pics are going to appear like you shot something out of a VGA camera.
 Apart from camera in low light  everything is great.
Low light images are not good enough
usually the phone while charging would show a red light this time when i charged the phone did not show any red light by this i can say that the phone is completely dead and can be thrown away  so please guys never ever buy low budget phones of lenovo 
--------------------------------------------------------
looks  7
If looks matter to you the looks are very decent  its sleek stylish and definitely fits in my pocket much better now after using SGNote.

By First Looks of it  It really seems to be awesome.

--------------------------------------------------------
5 gb  7
5 GB internal memory.
CONS  Back cover is prone to smudges  caught it after few touching  most of the time having problem in taking out the battery  almost 5 GB internal storage  out of 8 GB  is consumed at the initial level itself  had to buy micro sd card    asphalt game hangs miserably finally uninstalled it  screen guard  received with the set  contained many small bubbles when applied on the screen  music volume is on the lower side  should be increased  ear phone is of poor quality.
Low Internal Storage at 8 GB   makes it mandatory for you to purchase a extra micro SD card of at least 16 GB   i got a Samsung micro sdhc class 10   extra 500 and 16 GB OTG Pen drive 
5  GB only usable .
5 GB internal memory after excluding all apps.
With only 8 GB you will be able to install a handful of apps and after some 5 months  you will run out of space for apps.
5 gb is available for user.
--------------------------------------------------------
light in weight  -7
The front camera rather beats the 30 K phones by a good margin in good light conditions.
Good camera except in low light.
5. front camera is good for taking selfies in moderate low light 
Although there is a led light near the front camera visible while charging.
Battery backup is awesome  Light weight in 5.

 The weight is quite low to carry easily.
Look and feel   Very Light weight  good look  fine build quality   
Stylish Look  thin and weight less 
Tap to light  double click vol key to capture photo without turning on camera  wide touch  swipe bottom screen to light.
 Camera works perfectly fine and works best in good light conditions.
Video recording is very nice even with flash light its very clear.
But at low light these are pathetic.
Slim and low weight.
Low light images are not good enough
5 5  but in proper light its too good.
The looks are simply SEXY just plain old square edges but with that light weight and slim build it feels great to handle  and in.
2. having a much lighter weight as compare to the other phone at this price point.
So  taking pictures with flash during lower light conditions is improving the quality somehow but still I don t like it.
very handy because of less weight.
99mm thick  which feels a lot light in weight and thin in looks when compared to other models i ve used  except the iPod Touch.
Horrible focusing in low light and grainy picture
A bit noisy when taken inside on low light.
 Awesome camera super battery backup and light weight low priceee good product i suggested to my friends go for lenovo a7000.
The photos came pretty good at sufficient light but very much pixelated at the lack of light.
In low light both the cameras are not good.
15Very slim and light weight.
Low light pics are going to appear like you shot something out of a VGA camera.
Camera is not good captures grainy images in low light
5 Cameras are decent at this price point however the low light clicks are not so good.
With 2900 mah battery  the mobile is surprisingly feather weight.
First look and feel is too good light weight  slim.
flash is not working when taking photos at night or low light by using Default camera.
Not a good Camera in poor light.
I loved this phone it sound quality is good it is slim good looking not heavy weight camera is nice front camera is nice with features like blink play and hand shake capture touch is working good u should go for it and did not read positive reviews there is no touch problem design is also nice and best is battery.

usually the phone while charging would show a red light this time when i charged the phone did not show any red light by this i can say that the phone is completely dead and can be thrown away  so please guys never ever buy low budget phones of lenovo 
For a phone this big   the weight is deceptively low 
Pictures taken during low light are more horrible.

gaming  6
Gaming is a treat with no lag on the 1280 x720 display with all effects   the sounds make the gaming awesome   Ofcourse battery drys up after 5 hrs of gaming  it comes with a 1.
But the best thing about it is silky smooth gaming.
Another con is that it gets heated with heavy gaming .
5  No Heating  Didnt do intense gaming though  
Will test how much it heat up while gaming.
5  No Heating problem  didnt do intense gaming though .
my usage include heavy gaming  wifi usage.
5 gb internal storage  lowlight dual flash is taking gud pic to compare yureka alcatel  headset totally waste  i never seen before this like type of low quality android mobile headset  i throw it to basket  touch   gaming perfomens is great  battery perfomens is also gud  and two times i faced restarting problem  lightly heated when i played mostwanted 15min  if you guys like to hearing song with headset you not like this mobile 
no heating issues after moderate gaming.
I am not much of a gamer and with the kind of heating it undergoes under moderate usage it is safe to assume it will get heated further on heavy gaming.
--------------------------------------------------------
back cover  -5
The back cover feels extremely cheap plastic.
Now the back cover being so flimsy and loose to fit on the phone body  there is a great chance of water  specially in rain  slipping through that hole and do a obvious water damage if you do not take extreme precaution.
back cover not so good.
Lack of gorilla coating and strength of back cover demands case for rough users.
2 Back cover is necessary
CONS  Back cover is prone to smudges  caught it after few touching  most of the time having problem in taking out the battery  almost 5 GB internal storage  out of 8 GB  is consumed at the initial level itself  had to buy micro sd card    asphalt game hangs miserably finally uninstalled it  screen guard  received with the set  contained many small bubbles when applied on the screen  music volume is on the lower side  should be increased  ear phone is of poor quality.
The back panel is cheap and plasticy you might want a nice back cover 
for such a big phone  everyone uses a flip cover or a back cover.
The build of the phone feels cheap and the back cover is just a petty plastic which  once taken in hand reveals the price cut down areas of the manufacturer.
2  Back cover is not very good.
Back Cover looks good but the build quality poor  3.
6  Nice built quality but a metal back cover should have been best.
3  Product back cover is not that much good.
Back cover is very cheap
The only problem is the back cover  which is very slipery.
The back cover is very thin and seems to be made of low quality plastic.
2 Bad back cover quality  the back cover is very thin.
The back cover is plastic.

review  5
2015  I am giving a detailed review after using it for 15 days.
I have uploaded one video in you tube with  Lenovo A7000 user review  so you can check the same.
Feel free to go through my short review 
My first review on something  I felt like investing sometime to help other customers like me.
least 1 genuine review of the handsets they are putting on sell.
 i  ll give a complete review after one month of use.
This is not first review for this phone  so I m not gonna bore with same old technical details.
After much review and so much marketing by Flipkart I decided to purchase Lenovo A7000  The product was amazingly delivred before time   with good packing.
I don t want to give any star to this product but I have to   cause without that I am unable to give this valuable review to all my friends who are planning to purchase this device .
The phone is very nice   get good  I wrote this review after using 1  year.
Hope the review is helpful.
I never giving negative review of purchased product from flipkart with small problem except this a7000.
On the whole very much satisfied with this purchase and looking forward to explore more features to come up with a more detailed review.
So Wait for detailed review 
--------------------------------------------------------
music  5
if you want to experience better music then go for earphones like senheiser cx180 or better.
best music with dolby atum u feel just like a sony music but earphone is third class.
While the quality of music was nice  the volume was low.
5. headphone are not to good to hear music.
The device did not heat up during continued music playback  approx.
lots off effect inbuilt to take picture music quality is ok but with dolby you will feel nice music.
but income call sound and notification sound and music was very low.
Good music and video display 
--------------------------------------------------------
playing games  -5
No heating even while playing heavy games.
I am an average user who does mostly browsing and playing games sometimes.
so not good for playing games also.
i have not checked playing games on it but i think as per its specs it would run smoother.
while using this phone in 4G mode  and playing high graphic games  temperature rise too high.
Phone gets heated up while playing heavy games or 3G data while charging.
Not tried playing games on it yet.
3 gb which is good for playing any heavy games as i tried asphalt 8 which did not lag .
--------------------------------------------------------
a lenovo a7000  5
Tested Camera quality with my friend s Moto X 1st gen  ROFL my Lenovo A7000 is far better than that.
Seamless working and happy with Lenovo A7000

 i got a defective lenovo a7000 handset .

I bought a white Lenovo A7000 mobile.
--------------------------------------------------------
no gorilla glass  5
just wanted gorilla glass it would have been perfect.
This protection is somewhere equivalent between Gorilla glass 2   3  i. e. better than Gorilla glass 2 but lower than Gorilla glass 3.
Though lightweight  can get slippery and no gorilla glass so beware of falls.
I don t consider the absence of Gorilla Glass as a disadvantage as it has a special toughened glass.
No gorilla glass  you need to be careful   
Lack of Corning Gorilla glass should not be troubling you  as it has Asashi s Dragontail glass in it which i am not sure it as tough as gorilla glass.
camera quality is low no gorilla glass primary camera is low quality   secondary camera is bad quality i 4 month speaker was gon   hang the mobile 
--------------------------------------------------------
month  -4
lets c. above 3 month complete without problem only 1 problem plz increase internal memory 8 GB to short and plz improve UI 
For first 1 month it was good then it started giving touch issues.
immediately after initial first month  phone is never with me.
i have purchase this mobile last 4 month but now a days i am geting always different type of issue all sharing apps are not working i am not happy for this product 
i used this phone from three month  overall is good phone.
It has been only one and a half month of my purchase and suddenly yesteryday My phone became dead all of sudden.
again stop working now in 1 month   if u have a free time to go to.
 last month i have ordered lenovo a7000 n his touch is not working   n when i called customer service they told that we ll replace it   we cannot give refund   N flipkart is taking 1 months for replacement   i mean wht is this   
4. battrey backup is execellent in starting month but later on quitely reduced but it is good.
I purchased lenovo a7000 and using it from more than 5 month in this mobile their is connectivity problem in wifi hotspot otherwise its very good mobile 
went through the mobile world for one month and at last i bought this phone on the first day of sale itself .
I bought this phone before a month and was working very fine to me  before two days i had issue with the camera hence i took the phone to the service center  they checked the device and said the camera chip was short circuited and hence the phone will not turn on.
You cannot judge the manufacturing defects unless it is a month old and you can also not claim for a new mobile if its more than one month.
After one and half month of usage i will suggest those who want to go for this phone means please drop your idea.
 I have a brought this product and it is looking good  working well  internal memory was less and picture quality is low  8GB  after I brought this Lenovo have released within less than a month with 16GB version mobile with better features.
 Whithin two month of purchage charging issue appeared.
went to service centre with in a month  not happy with it 
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  -4
Most of the common apps will eat up your space and you are left with around 1 GB for playing around.
You are unable to download more apps as you get the warning  view phone storage inspite of the fact that you have external memory as well   you have set the download settings to card memory.
So you will run into this error frequently  insufficient device memory  while updating existing installing new apps 
The RAM size is 2 GB and almost 1 GB is available at any time after installing apps and with limited apps running in the background.
 it has accessibility to big games and unkown apps had great battery power but still to improve and the problem is Heating not as much as high 
So lock the whatsapp in recent apps.
Speaker is too good if and only if u download some good apps to listen songs like VLC App  Music Player App  Video App alngwith using Dolby Atmos.
Internal security apps also good
Automatically clears the opened apps.
phone consume 1gb ram always for preloaded apps and free only 1gb.
There are many useless apps and games but you can easily remove it.
The Best part is its look like a sony smartphone  many apps is also available in this phone and double click capture option is the best and uniqe feture .
Excellent speed with apps   other functioning.
Apps are movable to SD card.
1  Enough memory for alive Apps.
Apps open super fast until now no lag occured while using any of the application.
--------------------------------------------------------
service from flipkart  4
Do not expect such service from Flipkart.
Pathetic Service from Flipkart.
i have purchase the lenova A7000 on 29 april 2015 but the mobile volume is not working and key pad is also not working as i called the customer care for the return the product they are not ready to give me the refund money they are giving reasons and not ready to replace so i suggest not to buy any item from flipkart as the worst service i had .
I never expected such a worst service from flipkart.
A good service from Flipkart as well.
--------------------------------------------------------
in price range  4
Overall nice phone in this price range as you can t compare this price range with higher price range phone as you are paying less and you will be getting less.
good price range for features good price range for features good price range for features good price range for features 
Ear phones are of cheap quality  but with this price range it is not surprising. 
The product in this price range is good.
It is the Best Product you can get at this price range with such robust features 
specs are unmatchable with any mobile in this price range.
--------------------------------------------------------
front and back  -4
Secondly the camera quality is not enough good both as front and back.
Cameras front and Back are worst.
very poor performance of back camera  and front is average or above average.
8 Camera  back is sufficient in this price and front is superb  
I am using it for 2 months and UI VIBE is bad bad bad   Set is awesome   Back camera is bad   Truly bad   Front camera is good   Overall you can buy in this price   But now k3 note is available so don t ever buy this product on the place of k3   
Camera quality is very bad  both front and back.

6 months  -3
But don t know if it works fine after 3 or months 
I am using since last 2 months   in services station 20 days  3 times for the touch screen issue .
its been more than 5 months i am using this mobile phone.
But there is one problem after the usage of 2 months touch screen is damaged 
Using since 3 months and its working great.
 I have been using for the past 6 months.
using form 13 months.
I have been using lenovo a7000 for the past 3 months and I am quite satisfied with its performance.
I have been using it from last 8 months and now I feel all the excitement has gone which I had when I had used it for the first time.
Using it for last 9 months with no problem.
 I am using this for last three months.
Last two months back i have purchased this mobile  up to now i dosen t get any problem.
i am using this mobile since 3 months and my experience about the mobile is neutral.
Phone is fine but after using it for 3 months I can say its better to go for some other budgets phone over all experience not satisfactory 
I liked this product so much  that I suggested and gifted this product to my niece also  she is also using it for last coupple of months  and is very happy.
Using is from last 3 months and really satisfied with the performance.
Using it for past months and the usage is good.
Been 8 months now and it has been troubling me so much.
--------------------------------------------------------
wifi  3
network reception is very good including wifi.
The WiFi works very fine on the phone.
dont update the lastest update given to lenovo a7000  46mb  after update the wifi stops working and speaker gets defective 
Also I would like to mention it has a stronger Wifi reception than any ordinary phone.
 1 youtube is not working properly and shows error but in other device with same wifi same video will work good
--------------------------------------------------------
a little bit  -3
Call Quality 8 10   Volume is a little bit on the lower side.
little bit heating while charing 
Comes out both with Smile including a little bit of disappointment.
No heating issue at all for normal use but if u play games for an hour or more it heats a little bit and I don t think anyone plays games for an hour or so.
I would not have any objection if Lenovo charged a little bit more for the device with a gorilla glass on.
Felt a little bit of heating during gaming which is normal as in most of the phones of other brands but it does not hamper the performance at all.
This phone is not different  it heats a little bit but never more than 38 degree which is normal due to high usage of CPU.
3  Touch sometimes little bit slower and stuck.
--------------------------------------------------------
2 gb ram  2
Lollipop update makes it efficient   around 1 GB of available RAM makes   multi tasking a very easy one 
It s OS and hardware appear to be very new and awesome but they are just ok ok. 2 GB RAM is there but you won t get more than 1 GB of free RAM available.
RAM utilization is great more than 1 GB available.
RAM free space is already lesser  1GB approx.
The RAM size is 2 GB and almost 1 GB is available at any time after installing apps and with limited apps running in the background.
2 GB Ram is free normally   its more then the total ram of normal phones  while gaming even 800 Mb is free.
and 2 gb ram is usable .
install many apps and still 762mb ram is free of 2 gb.
RAM is always free around 1GB.
Bought this phone after reading review for a6000  and it didnt disappoint me within 9k it awesome 2GB ram   nice display camera quality i will tell above average but with 9k price tag camera works nice both front and back.
Multitasking   9 10   Around 1 GB of ram is free for your use rest is allocated for the system process.
2 GB RAM is sufficient for most of the users  I have installed as many as 25 Apps apart from default one  still it runs smoothly. 
a branded company selling a piece with 2GB RAM for 8999 is really GOOD.
Only 1 GB ram is user utilizable other is by OS
Two firmware updates down the line theres approximately 1450mb of free ram for usage of the 2gb  fair enough.
2 GB of RAM is decent to run many apps simultaneously.
Super fast processor and 2Gb ram is enough to keep the phone in same pace even when ur multitasking.
2gb ram is handalle every thing in fastly phone is much better than other brand.
--------------------------------------------------------
on first day  2
After reading so many positive comments I was already happy for the phone which myself and other people had bought on first day of sale.
75 hours of SOT on first day itself.
That is why I trusted to buy lenovo a7000 on the first day of sale.
Do not buy anything on the first day of the sale.
 I bought this mobile on the first flash sale  15th April  but received very next day  16th April .
I got this phone 6 months back  trust me its still working in the same way as it was used to work on first day hangs sometimes but automatically fixes in seconds  
 Grabbed this phone on the first day itself  first involvement in any flash sale any flash sale and bingo  I nailed it  just by going the reviews hands on that I have heard from  MWC2015 about the Dolby Atmos and 8mp camera 
So do never buy on first day.
Hats Off to Flipkart services   They first took the Easy return than also when i was heaving the problem with the Product than they picked up the product and Refunded the total amount on the same Day in my account.
I purchased it on first flash sale and here is my 7 day usage review.
Received the defect mobile first and got replacement and second mobile started giving problems from day 2 as it was working fine on Day 1. frequent Hangs and playstore is not working often with wifi.
went through the mobile world for one month and at last i bought this phone on the first day of sale itself .
I have purchased this lenovo a7000 mobile as a gift to my wife  just to upgrade her mot e  bought on first day sale from flipkart .
I recently bought the Lenovo a7000 in the first flash sale on April 15th and It got delivered the next day.
I bought this phone on it s first flash sale and got it delivered next day.
--------------------------------------------------------
to service center  -2
And on lenovno service center there is long que so it is totally wasting of time   money.
I have given to an authorized service center in Bangalore.
Quality of Phone is very cheap  no service centers and software problem always persist in phone.
Even when I reached to their service center   it was not good enough and many other people were complaing about this phone.
2015 after 3 months this is in service center due to board problem.
In Gujarat  there is not even sufficient service center.
--------------------------------------------------------
usage  2
Heats up with moderate usage.
Battery life was awesome can pass your day with heavy usage on a single charge 
Using it for past months and the usage is good.
Both back   front glass attract fingerprints   at longer usage could get slippery 
 Hello all  I m writing this review after 80 intense usage hours of Lenovo A7000.
It is okayish  which can end up to 8 hours max with decent usage.
70 hours of rigorous usage.
10 hrs with proper usage.
I have ordered this mobile and its been 2 weeks since its usage  so i can give my opinion unbiased.
With moderate usage  full time 3g all social media on  1 hrs game and 2 hrs music  phone lasted for  24hrs  
Wonderful battery life  36 hrs after moderate to heavy usage 
Reviews Posted after 4 months of intense usage.
Will update more after further usage.
in practical usage the battery life is very good compared to 3.
With intense usage of approx.
But as a whole at 9000 its a good phone for general usage if the user is not so bothered about the camera.
Two firmware updates down the line theres approximately 1450mb of free ram for usage of the 2gb  fair enough.
It gives 1 full day with 4g intense usage  with battery saver mode ON.
Battery 2900mAH   Fully charged phone 15 hours solid usage with moderate 3g use 
15 of basic usage.
Anyways  here are the Cons and Pros after a month s usage for those who are interested  
I get a backup of more than 10 hours with full usage.
Typing Is butter smooth with predefined common usage words and languages in eng and hindi.
gets warm within 30min of usage.
It was 51  when I got it  and after decent usage for 2.
which with the battery saving settings enabled and with moderate usage  18hrs a day wifi   3.
I am not much of a gamer and with the kind of heating it undergoes under moderate usage it is safe to assume it will get heated further on heavy gaming.
When I mean intense usage  I didnt take my hands off it even for a minute.
Starting with 100  battery level  I am able to use the phone for more than 24 hours  including night  with regular usage.
Battery was responding very good   i put lenovo a7000 under continuous wifi connection  social media  fb wtsapp  youtube usage was heavy  almost 4 hours of the day  for me it lasted for more than 2 days.
8 10  Lasts 1 day on high usage 1.
After the phone gave up  it literally died due to heavy usage and it s limited H W resources  I pitied and moved on  
 I purchased this mobile in June 2015  it is a really fast phone for the price scoring 42000  in antu benchmark out scoring the Mi4 and on par with oneplus one  it also received many software updates which is great  but since the last update  the touch wont respond whenever the device gets heated up and when the ram usage is high  after rolling back the update to S136  the problem still remains  which means that the software update damaged the touch digitizer or the screen  so i contacted lenovo customer support last week and they havent replied to me yet.
This phone is not different  it heats a little bit but never more than 38 degree which is normal due to high usage of CPU.
Totally satisfied with Initial usage.
 The phone offers a lot of features with performance at a steep price but cant really do much if device gets heated up even on moderate usage.
It lasted for 1 day with moderate to heavy usage for me.
--------------------------------------------------------
android  2
My initial requirement was a good android phone  I m coming from windows background.
Easy to setup like any other android and its up and running in five minutes.
The UI is great too and many enhancements done to Android available through the Settings is an icing on the cake.
Good for those buying android for first time who have earlier used Sony or Samsung will feel to throw this PHONE because of camera.
It gives joy of using latest android software i. e. Lollipop.
It has latest Android system  more RAM  more inbuilt memory than my old mobile.
My first Android experience since i have been using Windows for a long time till date.
in terms of performance it never hangs like other Android phones .
Intuitive and very similar to other Android phones.
1 GB is always accupied  may be due to Android Lollypop which also accupies most of internal memory of 8GB 
--------------------------------------------------------
power  -2
and completely stops if you use gpu power optimiser.
Power management is very good  so even if the battery goes down fast during heavy use it allows you to survive through ultimate power saver option.
an awesome budget phone with all the features packed in it with an power full punch and its front camera is brilliantly aewsome and back camera is not so it s processor make us to play games with high end graphics like deer hunt and many more games it gives us very speed with its 2 gb of ram i suggest you to buy this product 
 This is my first  flash sale  purchase exp and I m glad that  I m able to grab this power horse in the first sale itself.
Good charging time   approx 2hr 15min with charger provided with phone and ultimate power saving mode turned on.
Battery Life is super good   there is ultimate power mode that makes it a normal phone and can make it running for as long as 8 days
with super power mode  you can use it for two days 
it has  SUPER POWER  option which can last your battery for more than 2 days if you are on long journey and make casual and short duration calls.
--------------------------------------------------------
update  -2
It will get marshmallow update on September 
I received 3 updates till the time I am writing the review and it is recommended to update asap coz after first update Dolby was not functioning properly  but with second update it was booming.

--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
service centre  -2
Service centre is pathetic and they dont know how to repair.
but what they actually do just reset the mobile and give it to me for this they take 1week 3 days 10 days  In the service centre they are not treat us properly.
And to resolve it service centre takes minimum 15.
Service centre unable to resolve problem  phone taken in for repairs and asked to WAIT FOR TWO WEEKS 
--------------------------------------------------------
screen guard  -2
Lack of Gorilla Glass is compensated to some level with the given free screen guard.
3. screen guard is cheap.
The quality of screen guard is not that great  i suggest to put another one  3g connectivity has no problems .
--------------------------------------------------------

0 with vibeUI Though i am using Google now launcher  
--------------------------------------------------------
look and feel  1
Very light in hand   whatever you say but it is always a better feel when handheld device is lighter  
It is sleek look and when you open the box and hold it in hand does not feel as if you have picked the product.
1  The buttons on the side feel cheap
UI feel is great as well.
Look and feel   Very Light weight  good look  fine build quality   
But look and feel is rich. 
Feel free to go through my short review 
Look and feel is good

I suggest that phones are best bought from Amazon.
--------------------------------------------------------
day to day  1
on same day there were all customer of A7000 having same touch problem.
When I called the support team back  I was told that the call can only be scheduled for the next day.
Then I had to make a new request for return and they send me an automated email for calling me the next day and when they called today for whatever reason they could not hear me so send in a message that they will now call the next day  this is really disappointing.
I got this phone 6 months back  trust me its still working in the same way as it was used to work on first day hangs sometimes but automatically fixes in seconds  
I have used full day internet surfing using wifi battery drop only to 50 .
Next day another technician called and checked the mobile  he said mobile is fine  even though I was telling him the problem  he was not ready to accept.
Ordered the product on flipkart and to my surprise  got this delivered the next day.
I have purchased this lenovo a7000 mobile as a gift to my wife  just to upgrade her mot e  bought on first day sale from flipkart .
Battery seems to be lasting a full day.
7. battery performance is too good it provided you full day backup.
I am sure they could have made one more attempt to call ONE cannot wait for an entire day to make a single communication.
Hats Off to Flipkart services   They first took the Easy return than also when i was heaving the problem with the Product than they picked up the product and Refunded the total amount on the same Day in my account.
Battery seems to last long   but it cant be concluded in a day usage.
There is a reason behind that they dont want you to give chance to cancel the order so seems it was preplanned that they will deliver it next day early morning.
Another problem i encounter with this phone is whenever the battery is fully discharged   if you connect it to charger  it will not charge at all even if you plug in whole day long.
Delivery done by flipkart is too good as got the phone on next day of sale by 09 45 Hrs.
This is a story of first day mobile booking.
Will review it by tomorrow or next day 
That is why I trusted to buy lenovo a7000 on the first day of sale.
Battery back is normal it last up to one day with normal usage .
the phone s touch stops working in the second day itself .
Received the defect mobile first and got replacement and second mobile started giving problems from day 2 as it was working fine on Day 1. frequent Hangs and playstore is not working often with wifi.
It lasted for 1 day with moderate to heavy usage for me.
--------------------------------------------------------
sd card  1
Although you need memory card with this phone or it won t survive.
immediately i did one more tranaction with same debit card and it was succesful and i got my product.
CONS  Back cover is prone to smudges  caught it after few touching  most of the time having problem in taking out the battery  almost 5 GB internal storage  out of 8 GB  is consumed at the initial level itself  had to buy micro sd card    asphalt game hangs miserably finally uninstalled it  screen guard  received with the set  contained many small bubbles when applied on the screen  music volume is on the lower side  should be increased  ear phone is of poor quality.
After few applications and updates the internal memory gets full and many applications like fb  google packages  etc you cant move to external card.
After inserting external card   applications does not automatically select ext.
4  Audio files saved on external card canot be set as Ringtone directly  need to copy the the file to ringtone folder on phone memory.
Less internal space available so either 16gb or 32gb memory card is inevitable.
We can store apps in the external SD card as it has only 8 GB of internal Storage.
7 SD card movable apps  I m using 32 GB strontium class 10 with out any flaw

in lenovo a7000  1
 These are the problems i have faced in my new lenovo a7000.
Seamless working and happy with Lenovo A7000 
Why i am telling that Lenovo A7000 is worst mobile in the current market.
The earphones have been rendered absolute obselete  i think the entire lenovo A7000 first batch sold on flipkart is a defective batch  maybe others also might react by sending mails to you people.
flip kart can offer a free 1 tb storage drive but if once we place the order flipkart says We regret to inform you that the offer for 1 year office365 free subscription and 1TB storage was not available on Lenovo A7000  Due to some technical error it was displayed on the product page.
The features that s are given by Lenovo a7000 is enough  but the phones becomes very hot while charging that you can t touch it.
Battery was responding very good   i put lenovo a7000 under continuous wifi connection  social media  fb wtsapp  youtube usage was heavy  almost 4 hours of the day  for me it lasted for more than 2 days.
Today i have received their newly launched mobile Lenovo A7000 where i found that only one Sim is LTE and other sim only support 2 G. i have intiated the refund for my hard money as they are cheating consumers like us .
Lenovo A7000 I am very much satisfied with the product and the deal with u feel as amazing.
i bought new mobile lenovo a7000  it works like a heater  when did i complain the CC said this is the mobile how is built due to heavy processor.
Very disappointed with Lenovo a7000.
Please dont buy this mobile Lenovo A7000  its a china local product.
i m first time purchasing in mobile lenovo a7000 from flipkart side.
