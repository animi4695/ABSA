the sound quality is good most of all the 720p screen is perfect it gives you a sharp images the camera is most complicated it takes good pics at manual mode than auto front also best at manual mode it has some other features like slo.
Good Sound Quality.
If you use a good quality headphone than use direst HD Sound from default music app for incredible sound.

this is the first phone or may be the only  in 7k range that can run GTA in high graphics again the credit goes to the meizu.
T720 gives u a good performance on high graphics games like GTAsan andreas  yes this phone can run GTA san andreas on high graphics just switch the phone to performance mode and there you go.
