2 Average battery life  2500mah runs down to 10  of heavy use of 3 hours.

Thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery  The product is good but battery backup very lo while reduced earlier manner .
Battery back up very poor and and heating issuesWorth for money phone.
The phone hangs a lot  battery life is also not good.

And battery backup is poor.
My YU Yureka plusheating problem in yu yurekha plus phone and restart problemgood product according to price but found some heating problem at back speaker areaBattery Backup is very poor.
heat problem is present only when playing large games but in usual use is normal battery charging is slow   taking 3 hours   but after one week decreases to 2.
in the system update optionthis phone is looking very nice in design and its weight is good  but its poor battery backup and heating problem is big issue of this smartphone.
IT HAS HEAT PROBLEM AT BACK N CAMERA IS AVERAGEgot this phone 29th july  and then one whole day i found lot of problems and bugs like heating issue battery life draing if u using fb messenger and opera then 3 30 hours maximum battery life for yu yureka plus.
Battery backup is so poor that it only work for 4 hours before complete discharge.
the battery life is hopeless.
But only lagging thing in this mobile is  it has a very poor battery backup.
the company assures you a battery life of 8 hours but don t expect more than 5 hours.
The poor battery won t see you through even half a day Why because it has to deal with twice the amount of pixels and a  fire emittting dragon AKA snapdragon615.
7  lastly sound clarity is awesome with inbuilt  AudioFX  which provides amazing sound while using Headphones like sKallcandy  Sony EtcCons  1  seriously guys YU has done a blander mistake of giving 2500mh battery for such large disply it drains quickly.
Voice clarity during call is very bad and battery is running only 4 hrs and it has heating problem also.
Neutral 1  Battery lifeAmazon delivered the product in 5 Days.
But battery is poor.
do not see its specification its hardware is very bad camera not good  heating of phone up to 53 degree battery drain very fast and its customers care always give you one solution for these problem go for factory reset  so my suggestion do not buy such bad product1.
Battery back up is poor.
I have been using the phone since 5 days and i encountered some drawbacks like low battery life.
i decided to buy this mobile due to 2 reasons  one due to 16gb internal memory and 2500Mh battery which would last for atleast 2 days  but in fact the battery life lasts for one day with my frequently checking mails.
there s a heating problem and charging takes place slowly and charging reduces even if cell is not in useHeating problem is too much  Battery drains out very quickly  call ringer profile needs attention  over all my money is wasted it seems.
2 android updates since it got released hasn t resolved the issue  seems to an issue with hardwareNice mobile but could have been better if battery backup should be improved as battery backup is poor as per 2500 mah is concernedScreen and performance is good.
Also though the Yureka Plus has improved the camera and offers a 1080p display  the battery life is still average and heating issues persist.

worst mobile  -122
Yureka is not a good product.
I am using this mobile since last 15 days Pros   1  user interface is good.
YU yurekha plus is a good mobile  heating issue problem others function goodnot at all  it s dialar is very slow hangs most of time.
It is the same as the Yureka and there s no change.
Its battery is draing like crazy and i suppose that the device is defective.
Colour reproduction is not as good and it comes out to be washed out.
Excellent Mobile from YurekaBest phone with all featuredNot but but features is goodBest phone in low budget  Over heating bad performanceGreat phone with least PriceGood phone and good featuresnot as freiendly as expectedVery bad phone heats so muchToo much heating problems.
display gone in very first datEIts the best phone at this price coupled with CyanogenMod  but due to heating issues it lags a bit  have downloaded the CpuTemp app to monitor  the temp always been 10 degree C more as compared to Yureka for same working   operating condition.

3GHz Quad Core 16GB ROM 2GB RAM 13MP CAM Android KitkatI found it better then YU Yureka Plusur time is well bcz u r not foolish   first use this mobile from anybody brought then say me ur opinion .
I m unhappy with this device because when I installed Facebook app heating increases suddenly and lags little bit.
It is an inherent property of Android that it creates thumbnails of the media files on the device due to which  it s likely that the device may get heated up or might lose excessive battery.
I ve applied the APN also properly ut it is still not allowing me to access internet what should I do Mobile is good but too much heating and low battery backup.
But only 1 Sim is working for 4GHello my phone is damage on bottom so please replace another pieceThe device is very good except heating while playing online games.
Now coming to the product  First of all there s no way to identify if its Yureka or Yureka Plus other than the writing on the cover of the box.
Good device  but baittry problems parfomance not well2G internet runs much more slower than normal speed .
The device overall feels solid.
overall good product.
I was very excited about this whole new Yureka Plus mobile launch and ordered on the first sale itself on 24 July 2015.
Not a good product.

The company touts that the Yureka Plus is a next.
Overall  the product is well built  and has good specifications for this price segment.
perfect mobile very goodawesome device  must buyThe best phone ever.
No one reverts properly and I will suggest not to buyI m using it since 2 month and Mobile works good but battery drains very fast and about gaming performance it lags in big games like asphalt when having games installed more than 3.
But overall its a good mobile.
Awsome phone very nice touch screen  sound and camera quality is bestAmazon service was the best product is delievered within the timeAmazon returned the extra amount once the price of YU Yureka had droppedI must say that u should buy this product from amazon to enjoy excellent serviceI m very thankful to yo companyThis mobile is great great great and great for allAnyone who want to buy just go for it don t think on its heating becs all are saying that it s heat too much.
The speaker on the Yureka Plus is not great but still good.

Its not a good mobile.
Camera is goodThe device is dead for about a month now and no service has been provided towards the issue.
i hate yu yureka.
In fact  it fell down from a normal regular coffee table and i wonder why it break like this   I think it s better you tell the Yu Yureka guys to name the glass they are using  as infant   baby gorilla glass  because  based on the quality of the above said glass used by Yu Yureka and how it shattered  i think  a even a new born baby can scratch and break it.
Good Mobile but little heating problemIt is nice product but sometimes hangsOnly heating problemOtherwise OKIt is is waste product buy from amazongreaaatttt phn.
Better to buy some other mobile.
I just loved itgood performance about device and great  service by amazonnot good product of this yureka lot of problem in mobile every time its hangingIssues  phone is too slowPhone get heat early2 GB ram but of no useAll is okay .
In my new Yureka Plus  I can t able to download updates it takes hell lot of time.
But then I inserted my battery in some other YUREKA phone.
It s a good mobile but battery is not good and have heating problemsWrong commitment 8999 Rs.
This my 2nd phone I happy my friend liking this phone I suggested them go for it  M MaheshwaranI would not recomend the Yureka Plus due to 2 Major Issues  1  The mobile gets heated extremely while charging  listening songs  watching the movie  etc.
Functionally too goodIts good product launched by YU and I m using YU  its has good performance .
voice quality very poor  Device used to get heat up while on charging or in talking mode .
Not bad not goodheating like sunAll YU series are bad mobile I request don t buy the any mob of YU seriesThe best phone I ve ever seen.
the product overall performance is good.
Nice and awesome to use compare to higher phone i think better and awesomeThe smart phone Yu Yureka Plus is very useless.
color feel is awesome n config is very much supportiveBest in price and performance but has heating problem otherwise it is good product from Yumobile is getting over heat  no one are answerable for this and battery backup is not goodThis mobile is a very low battery and hitting problem .
Heating Issuenice featured phone the heating problem is only there which makes the phone uncomffortable to use atherwise all is good and nice camera is also goodTHIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE BANNED ON AMAZON1.
I had literally wasted my 9k bucks on this phnI don t know why people are saying that Yureka Plus is not a good mobile  but after analyzing all the features and hardware configuration I felt that this is really one of the best mobile within 10K range.
If any one looking for new device don t purchase it.
8th day of use  and it s certainly as per the amazon return policy for this product  the mobile is now out of it s 14 days return policy  I ve been given Micromax service center support number to contact  when I called the amazon customer care  one of the worst product which looks good in features  but has a great back draw.
Really wastage of money and bad device.
not always necessary Thank YouHopless phoneHeating issuegood productsIt is worst phone   there is no battery life and network issueReally nice mobile.
Best in class camerait is a great mobileDont buy laggy phoneVapas kb aayega bhaiCamera was very bad.
As this phone is having issues with the basic functionality of a phone  it is a useless device.
Phone is hanging while operatingGood product in this price rangeWorst phone ever seen in my lifevalue for money.
yeahh device looks awesome.
let s see how the phone work s nowNot a good product.
First the buttons for volume and power are not good in Yureka Plus.
phone has dialer issue backup issue and the phone is not having proper camera as need to be in with flash their is serious issueThe product is very good.
Some improvements over last yureka.
Features are good  but during low signal device will become heat.
its was heating verymuch  I though to return it and after yureka launched updates I updated and its working fine.
We have spend money on new device and if the piece is faulty it has to be replaced with new one.
its even worse then yureka .
V. K. GargIts a sleek Full HD device with octa core processor  within this price range device is awesomeVery nice mobile.
1 yureka is better than thisGood product for that price.
GoodNiceniceNiceThis phone is just s. Just a dump product.
First of all yu yureka is heating too much .
Product was not good.
Other reviews mentions about the device getting heated up  but its not so true.
Now coming to what can be done in this device  first upon immediately receiving the device  enable privacy options to all by default  then go to advanced privacy settings and make sure all apps  except the ones that we really need   use often whatsapp  gmail  playstore etc  that need not be i. e games occasionally used apps etc and disable Auto Start and keep awake.
I have charging issue problem with device   battery is absolutely working fine in other device same for charger also .
amazing phone at amazing  priceawesome product  amazon serviceI bought it 3months back and its perfomance is good with good autofocus camera and other features are good at this price point.
I had bought a Yureka earlier and this is my second Yu phone.
getting too much heating problem  battery issue draing too fast  and the most important that the device is getting hanged too many times  even u can imagine my situation whne i m trying to call some person it is taking a while to process call and start the ui.
Product is good as hardware point of view  very powerfull hardware at low cost but I am not satisfied with software performance it too much buggy and finally want to say that YU did not kept his promise to give new software update every month.
Gaming performance is very poor I can t play temple run and subway surfer  a very cheap device can play this games.
l had received these informations from the other yureka customers JOJI ABRAHAMYes  i am having a good experience of cynogen in YU yureka plus  its a good phone in budget.
An Indian product having sizzling features that can even compete with phone like oneplus Xiomi in all sort of hardware and software specs Cyanogen allows to handle the phone in a friendly way Yu Yureka plus Go for it Great service from AMAZON Everything is fine except poor battery and heat     What is the benefit of HD screen or good hardware if you can t play with it for a while without charging and burning your fingers  It is good gadget but is certainly not a good mobile device as you have to sit near a socket to enjoy it   SADDD   Battery drains like a glass of water.
overall good product at this price Battery Back up is very poor if you charge it in morning 7 AM it will not with you even 5 PMIs yu yureka plus supports fast charging feature   As its lacking in original yureka phone.
Otherwise awesomeGood Phone  better camera than original yureka.
I felt that K3 Note is far better than Yureka  .
The animations switch at a slightly slower rate and apps also take slightly longer to switch when compared to the original Yureka.
OVERALL GOOD PRODUCT   DISPLAY   GAMING PERFORMANCE ARE SO GOOD   BATTERY LIFE AND CAMERA ARE GOOD   BUT AFTER PLAY GAME   IT S TEMPERATURE GOT SO HIGHHi GuysThe phone is good on this price  but some discrepancy in it1  .
From Yureka to Yureka Plus i d t think so major updates but anyway with in this budget this is good one.
overall good product by amazon.awesome mobile  155
Product is good  but getting heated from back side very soon facing this problem.
It was a frustrating experience to buy it is a good product i buy it in 9999 and two month later 1000 gift card came becoz it price down after next day when i placed orderVery bad .
Very good   i bought  yu yureka  4 month ago   and now i bought  yureka plus  i will buy next model of yureka as well   best phone   no hang problem   but battery is not goodWorst product ever purchased.
Third it has been said everywhere that the screen resolution of Yureka Plus is much better than Yureka but I hardly see any difference.
Dont  go for this yu yureka brand  i purchased yu yureka in last march month and from  the day one itself i am facing o many issues like very poor batter back up  its taking 10  to 12 hrs to recharge in full and it will drain out in 3 to 4  hrs of normal use and over heating is an issue that its very difficult to hold in hand or hold near to our ears  network issue is like we have make reboot this set 10 times a day to get normal use  software issue is also a never ending processes   i made so many complaint to this customer care department and every time they given a new registration number  my complaint No  are   1096295 and 108236  and every time they are giving some weird answers  most of the time when we call them they will hold our call min.
I appreciate all YU people for giving such a beautiful device.
Hope YU comes with a better device within same price range.
Other than heating problem the device is fine.
And I am pretty happy with the device.

It is an inherent property of Android that it creates thumbnails of the media files on the device due to which  it s likely that the device may get heated up or might lose excessive battery.
I have used Redmi 1s and honestly that phone is a heating device and could be used a mini iron box.
So after using yureka plus for a week I am writing this review and I am happy with the device because the cost you are paying for this phone neglects all the cons.
product is almost good but there is one problem.
Otherwise all goodBeekar phone of the yearMobile drying very fast and full heatingIts a very good mobile phone at this price.
Good servicce support from AMAZON and partners YU Yureka  mobile is good   they need to address the heating up of the mobile during usagePerformance is OK but when I go to dial upSo sometime its hanging .
Like its predecessor  the Yureka Plus is also a dual.
i was very excited to buy this one but this is really a very very bad mobile  never buy this one.
Good product  but pretty bad initial configuration.
But good product yurecs plus .
please don t except this phone for daily driverTotally waste of money you can get better device for 9k rather than this crappy slab mud phone.

The battery life is below average and I am a moderate user but after 6.
Battery drains quite fast.
too much heating problemNice product  But battery is not a good.
Performance  built  camera superb  only battery life is little less.
And also battery backup is not good.
Battery backup not so good.
It just looks good on paper but real life performance is pretty standard.
it heats within 5mins if u use mobile internet n it produces heat which is greater than the outside heat city s temperature Cool phone under 10000Yureka plus is a beast phoneI would give it a five star ratingThe only prblm is battery life but it can be solved by using apps other than that proud on yureka plus and proud for YUI book on 10 Aug. 2015   received on 14 Aug. 2015 .
Loud speakers are worst headphones are best low audio on call battery drains rapidly and takes too much time for full charge.
Second  the battery drains way too fast even when its not being used.
2 Average battery life  2500mah runs down to 10  of heavy use of 3 hours.
But battery life is worse.
but that problem alone is enough to cause a lot of other problems like short battery life  device up time and device life as well .
Heats up lot always 60c or 60 c degree and battery drain issue and most hating thing is slow charge  it took 6.
Build quality is OK  camera could be bit betterThe mobile is good but battery life is bad .
Phone is used n scratches alsobattery backup is not so good.
There is a heating problem but it s tolerable  battery life is below average to put it nicely  the screen is awesome and camera is good too.
Thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery  The product is good but battery backup very lo while reduced earlier manner .
Battery back up very poor and and heating issuesWorth for money phone.
The phone hangs a lot  battery life is also not good.
My YU Yureka plusheating problem in yu yurekha plus phone and restart problemgood product according to price but found some heating problem at back speaker areaBattery Backup is very poor.
And battery life is gud onlyGood But it take so much time to recharge battery  Sometimes it became so heat very very poor battery it diidn t that expect that worst batteryA very gud ph.
Front camera very nicePoor battery backupHeats little much but it manageable for meSome key features missing13MP working not as Good I think9000 is a good priceThat s why I buy thisProcessor is also not too fast that I thinkLook wise not so goodTakes 4 hours to full charge that irritated meYU is a new company still have to learn a lotThanku hopes this review helps youNot able to give less than this.
And battery backup is poor.
The battery life should be good for most people  but in the case you are looking at heavier usage Xiaomi s Redmi Note will offer better battery life.
heat problem is present only when playing large games but in usual use is normal battery charging is slow   taking 3 hours   but after one week decreases to 2.
in the system update optionthis phone is looking very nice in design and its weight is good  but its poor battery backup and heating problem is big issue of this smartphone.
IT HAS HEAT PROBLEM AT BACK N CAMERA IS AVERAGEgot this phone 29th july  and then one whole day i found lot of problems and bugs like heating issue battery life draing if u using fb messenger and opera then 3 30 hours maximum battery life for yu yureka plus.
Battery backup is so poor that it only work for 4 hours before complete discharge.
the battery life is hopeless.
But only lagging thing in this mobile is  it has a very poor battery backup.
the company assures you a battery life of 8 hours but don t expect more than 5 hours.
The poor battery won t see you through even half a day Why because it has to deal with twice the amount of pixels and a  fire emittting dragon AKA snapdragon615.
7  lastly sound clarity is awesome with inbuilt  AudioFX  which provides amazing sound while using Headphones like sKallcandy  Sony EtcCons  1  seriously guys YU has done a blander mistake of giving 2500mh battery for such large disply it drains quickly.
Voice clarity during call is very bad and battery is running only 4 hrs and it has heating problem also.
Neutral 1  Battery lifeAmazon delivered the product in 5 Days.
But battery is poor.
do not see its specification its hardware is very bad camera not good  heating of phone up to 53 degree battery drain very fast and its customers care always give you one solution for these problem go for factory reset  so my suggestion do not buy such bad product1.
Battery back up is poor.
I have been using the phone since 5 days and i encountered some drawbacks like low battery life.
i decided to buy this mobile due to 2 reasons  one due to 16gb internal memory and 2500Mh battery which would last for atleast 2 days  but in fact the battery life lasts for one day with my frequently checking mails.
there s a heating problem and charging takes place slowly and charging reduces even if cell is not in useHeating problem is too much  Battery drains out very quickly  call ringer profile needs attention  over all my money is wasted it seems.
2 android updates since it got released hasn t resolved the issue  seems to an issue with hardwareNice mobile but could have been better if battery backup should be improved as battery backup is poor as per 2500 mah is concernedScreen and performance is good.
Also though the Yureka Plus has improved the camera and offers a 1080p display  the battery life is still average and heating issues persist.
echo is coming when i give a phone call some time blank screen is comeBattery life is more important for any phone  but there is nothing like thatthis product get heated soon and battery drain soon.
buy lenovo Sony etc Samsung is better this is the wrost phone battery problem over heating charging problem low quality camera Product is very poor .

bad performance  -48
8 hours and some times its heating   so please give me the suggitions for slow performance of the phone.
I have used yureka also and it is nowhere similar to the performance of yureka even yuphoria for that matter is Superior in performance department.
Performance is awesome and gaming is awesome too although phone gets heated a little bit but not that much that you can t even handle the phone.
Battery life is poorBattery backup is very very poorGood performance.
fine build quality  but poor performance  gets heated up so easily  lags in between.
I charged it and started using the product the product looks really good looks wise but performance is not that good.
battery performance is very poor.
But not satisfied with its performance.
Not high end earphones but are no way behind in performance   read  accurate performance .

Battery is having low performance.
Overall performance is good  recommend to buy it.
Overall performance of the phone is quite good.
So to conclude you cannot expect more then Spec s at this priceSo if you are looking for a good built and high performance this is not the device for you.
Performance very poor.
In most reviews   they have mentioned that graphics performance is smooth   but in Subway surfer I noticed frame drops and stuttering performance .
Mobile is gud but have heating problem while continue talkingEvery thing OK expect heating issue during using camera  WiFiCynogen mode is awesomeOverall performance is excellentYUREKA THE WORST PHONE EVER YU IS A BIG CHEAT I MADE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING A YUREKA HANDSET AND IT HAS BEEN A HELLISH EXPERIENCE.

Very poor performance with 12.
i don t touch phone after 15 minute because it s so hotPhone gets heated very frequentely  Performance is very slow.
gaming   performance little optimized well.
For me its OK but for performance freaks I am not sure if you will like this.
low quality   overall performance is very poor.
but overall performance  look HD video  cynogen OS hide all cons.
Received yesterday  pretty decent performance   Bit heating issue but not too hot n all   Just warm sometimes .
Functionally too goodIts good product launched by YU and I m using YU  its has good performance .
Worst camera has heating issues average battery backupWorth for the money  But battery performance is low.
very poor performance i am very very unhappy with this mobile.
Overall performance is satisfactory and the battery is also quite Good.
worst and slowing overall performance.
Gaming performance is very poor I can t play temple run and subway surfer  a very cheap device can play this games.
heating up of the phone and the consequent slowing down in the performance  poor battery usage time  backup time .
Overall performance is satisfactory .
Firstly the most serious problem is the laginess in overall performance.
I was not happy with the performance of the handset so I HAD TO RETURN it back .
Overall the performance of the  phone is good but it has serious heating issue and battery drain problem.
Great performance in the sense that while playing large games it will not stuck at all.
Solve this problem if possiblebetter performance and good camera .
The positive side of the phone is that camera quality is good works smoothly  if not heated  performance is okay.
Thanks YUREKA  NaveenI got this just yesterday and i am forced to write a negative review due to the bad performance.
Thankfully its not throttled  meaning its able to go all out on performance.
Second  it still has the old version of cyanogen mod which has poor visible performance which can be seen while unlocking the phone.
but overall performance is good.great performance  53
Charger is not working its faulty product out of the boxPerformance is a bit on slower side for a 2GB ram mobilebattery backup is not sufficient performance is not goodUsing last one year.
gaming   performance little optimized well.
Nice phone with good performance and with some minor cons.
better performance.
All the descriptions are right but the performance is too low.
has Best performance over 2GB games.
Except that   this is a brilliant performance device   the first boot gives lag but reboot it it will be a treat .
2 android updates since it got released hasn t resolved the issue  seems to an issue with hardwareNice mobile but could have been better if battery backup should be improved as battery backup is poor as per 2500 mah is concernedScreen and performance is good.
Performance is okay.
Awesome camera abd awesome performance.
performance is took good.
However  there is not much difference in performance in real.
Performance is good.
Performance is very poor and frequently gets stucksNo Doubt Phone Price Right As Per Per ConfigurationWorst Don t Buy It Is Like Heater    Heats Too MuchNice but some functionalities are not upto the markvery very less battery backup.
This mobile had potential to become the best but it couldn t because of poor optimization  serious heating issues  poor battery performance  frequent lagging  and frequently  call dropping issues.
fast awesome performance.
I just loved itgood performance about device and great  service by amazonnot good product of this yureka lot of problem in mobile every time its hangingIssues  phone is too slowPhone get heat early2 GB ram but of no useAll is okay .
Great features and also good performance.
it is good to use with latest technologybut ya off course battery drain out fasterfrankly speaking this problem you will find everywhereHas better features than other models at this price range and performance is also good.
The 2 500mAh battery largely offers similar performance than that of the older Yureka.
They have much better performance than eureka plus.
The phone in short is according to its price of 8999 and does not provide ant extra ordinary performance.
Verdict Expect for battery yureka delivers in every way look feel performance and custmization optionsIf you are OK with charging twice in a day but need everything else go for it won t dissapointBefore buying this product read yu yureka mobile riviews.
Battery performance is also good.
yureka plus give good  performance both camera s are good  selfi camera is very good  primary camera is also good.
Battery  Very Good for full day users along with wifiCamera   Very Good but having fade quality issue in light but it can adjustableRAM   2GB DDR3 is very good performanceProcessor  615 QUALCOMM AwesomeDisplay   Full HD Awesome qualityPerformance   ExcellentCustomization  Very Good and innovativeTouch   Very GoodSound Quality and Head Phone  Vey Very Good QualityCharger   Very Good qualityOverall phone quality and performance is excellent expect some time phone heat at playing game and its a comman issue in all phones as per my experience.

everything  16
So lesson learned  donot believe everything on paper .
Everything else is working great.
haiBattery is not up to the mark other wise everything is OK.
Rest everything is bad.
In my opinion everything is OK but one most problem of this is HEATING.
remaing everything is great.
operating system  camera  speed  headphone quality  smooth touch  everything is cool.
Otherwise everything is fine.
Rest everything is great except the following consCons 1.
It s feeling good to useGot this phone 10 days back  everything is excellent in the phone.
Everything is working fine but hearing issue is there.
Has heating issues and battery drained out too soonPerfect for everything.
Everything is OK except video which gets hang sometime.
Good looking phone  almost everything is good but while talking it heats very badly can t even hold for 5 mins.
using from 4days everything is fine in yureka plus except two things one is company says that offering 13mp but photos are not up to the mark both front   rear camera.
An Indian product having sizzling features that can even compete with phone like oneplus Xiomi in all sort of hardware and software specs Cyanogen allows to handle the phone in a friendly way Yu Yureka plus Go for it Great service from AMAZON Everything is fine except poor battery and heat     What is the benefit of HD screen or good hardware if you can t play with it for a while without charging and burning your fingers  It is good gadget but is certainly not a good mobile device as you have to sit near a socket to enjoy it   SADDD   Battery drains like a glass of water.
Everything is good by this price but poor battery back upthis product is hanging some times and no charge back up Just a very bad phoneTrue wastage of valuable moneyPhone gets heat very soon.
Everything so perfect.
WTF  this is chutiyapaaExcept battery backup and over heating everything is fine.
First time got a defective one 2nd time everything is going fine so far fingers crossed.
57W Kg at body  one of the reasons I didnt buy k3 note And rest everything is fine.
except that everything is fine.
love itMobile will heated up slightly wn browsing n gaming other than that everything is fine n working good.
Everything is OK but battery backup is very less.
Overall phone performance  look  camera everything is awesome with this budget we cant compare it other mobiles.
else everything is fine .
everything is good about the product  onlu the thing that is not so good is the camera quality.
Everything is OK but mobile is getting heat while using internet or playing games.
But remaing features like touch sensitvity everything looks fine.
Except heating problem everything is fine.
--------------------------------------------------------
days of usage  -15
battery lasts for 8hours with heavy usage.
worst battery backup and most defect is over heating while on phone calls and using internet even 5mins usage and good in cameraWorth for money .
phone heats up even for less usage.
My suggestion is that if your usage is general  restricted to mails  messaging and calls  try out the phones with not so good specs.
battery backup is one day for moderate usage.
Battery draing very fast approx 2 hour at moderate usage after full charge.
40min of continuous usage  temp is not that high  but if you are using ur mobile during the temp raises and sometimes it heats very badly.
It may be either due to excessive usage of applications or media files.
Mobile gets restarted once per day if heavy usage is done  camera usage .
Hardly lasts a day with average usage .
hot hot hot within small usage.
These reviews undermine the most important aspects which affects the daily usage of the phone.
Nearly 4 days of heavy usage.
3 hrs with moderate usage   .
There are numerous bugs in the product making for extremely unfriendly usage most bothersome of which is the random and unpredictable rebooting of the phone  often while trying to make calls.
This means the phone will in most cases easily last you a full day with medium to heavy usage.
No software optimsation  battery drains like hell even with moderate usage .
4 hrs at max with very little usage.
Upon moderate usage  my battery came from 100  to 95   in just about 10 to 12 mins.
Battery easily lasts 1 to 1 and half days on moderate to heavy usage.
Even with minimal application usage  it gets warm near the top side of the device.
All features packaged in Yu are doubtlessly superb  Based off my extensive usage since I purchased it  have the following analysis about it Pros 1  Good quality images and Videos with the Camera .
The phablets due to thier screen size  must have at least 3000mah battery to last a day of moderate usage.
Battery backup is little disappointing but rest assured it will last 3 4th a day on moderate usage.
The battery life should be good for most people  but in the case you are looking at heavier usage Xiaomi s Redmi Note will offer better battery life.
I thought after few days of usage it will get alright but to my bad it is getting worse.
Gives about 2 days of use on moderate to heavy usage.
Day to day usage is fast and smooth.
But the I didn t like the amount of heating even without heavy usage.
It doesn t last even a day with heavy usage including gaming.
Poor phone  heating issue   battery back up and lag issue  very poor performanceCamera is also not goodHeating and poor battery performance on heavy usage but the problem of heating is quite common on this deviceBattery downs very quickly.
good for multi usage.
my device gives me backup of 1 complete day on moderate usage and thats enough for me.
go for it   Its worth for all ur moneySo far so good in particular  the navigation bar adjustments  and clock adjustments superb  i think it is because of cynogenat first it has some minor app issues after update all the application in the play store seems it is good now  extraordinary music effects  superb video qualityexpecting the OS update toowith wifi usage phone keep 4 to 5 hours backupif you use WIFI  Mobile DATA  GPS  all the features then gone in two hour to extend your battery life switch off the features that is not need after a long search  i found a settings under display adaptive brightness  use lot of power once i turned off  seems the battery extends it s lifeAsphalt 8  have some lag on some particular maps and cars in particular some high end cars  this means need more processing power  but for a phone with this price it s ok have some minor bug in messaging app  you are not able to easily pick numbers from your contactswho the hell say that it has a poor customer service to me there is problem in a my ear phone send a mail and tell the details of my phone once the problem is identifiedwith in five days the replace with a new oneDo not buy this  You ll repent in few days.
Battery gets drained in just half a day of moderate usage.

full hd screen  12
But as soon you start using  the full HD screen takes it toll on the battery.
15 hrs at stand byPerformance  is not upto the mark but works fine with high end gamesDisplay of the phone is very sharp  but when u see images or videos of full HD resolution it disappoints us.
Battery for android phones is always a issue and to add to the problem this phone is full HD display so you can expect battery discharge issue.
phone is very awosm display quality with full hd display 1080p display  and 401 ppi display .
V. K. GargIts a sleek Full HD device with octa core processor  within this price range device is awesomeVery nice mobile.
Honestly for the full HD screen of 5.
The cameras and full HD screen was unbeatable.
It provides Full HD but it is useless as we have to keep brightness ZERO  Battery draing issue.
pros 1. big screen with crystal clear display with full hd experience 2. good experience with caynogen OS and all its advantages 3.
Sound is loud and also full hd.
Company says full HD but if i play 1080 videos from YouTube or internal memory phone lags to process the video.
I used the phone last few months  fully satisfied  camera quality really good Sony HD screening Not so good.
Same as yureka but only difference is full HD screen   nothing else I have bought this phone its an amazing beast.
Have been using this for a week now and this phone is awesome  The design is quite nice and the full hd display is awesome.
It has extraordinary features at its price range display is good Phone is slow in processing when compared to canvas nitro 2  camera is also not as good as canvasnitro2Battery somewhat OKInitially heating was annoyingOverall its processing is not as fast when compared with nitro 2 and gets struck sometimesI had the previous version of this phone   but with the addition to full hd screen   new camera   a sturdy body .
Boasting Full HD screen very nice to watch videos  reading news or novels.
The full hd display is not just in words.
The rear camera has full hd recording and the videos are great too.
Fast and Fluid responsive touch  Full HD display is really good  more importantly battery backup is really good  stays a day long which is brilliant for this spec .
Its a great phone with full HD display within 15  discount on yureka plus moondust grey  during freedom sale.
full HD screen is the plus point.
Battery is optimized well by cyanogen so that it can give same back up as that of yureka  even for full HD screen 6. chargering is faster because of 1.
Yes the screen or display is full HD .
5. inch full HD 1080p IPS display  which is further protected with a layer of Corning s Gorilla Glass 3.
And comparing features to price u canNot even say it less worthed   every penny u pay has its value in this phone from full hd display to 5.
Super Heating  Since this is YU 2nd product after hugely popular and success yu yureka  it has improved in display and cameraThe display is now 1080p full HD and surely looks nice and beautiful.
neither it is full HD nor its ppi is 401. one of the worst screen resolution.
Not full HD display  battery backup is 12 hours  Dont Buyvery bad experience.
full hd awsome finish octacore snapdragon really roars .
Mega Pixel does not matter  2MP   full HD  need a better sensor.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad_sound  -8
YU fixed the earlier camera issues in the new YU plus Sound quality is good through Headphones  but the sound is low in loudspeaker.
Low sound and sensor doesn t work properly  when you are talking the screen turns on and opens calender  or other apps.
Input sound or headphones sound is also poor and after sometimes it start lagging too.
when i buy this its price was 9 999 but nwit reduced to 8 999 its alose for me about 1000 hw can i regain thisPhone s sound is vibrating  speaker or the headset s sound is broken not audible I will be returning it Amazon2 problems is 1  heating 2  Camera quality could be better  but for this price range  it is excellent product.
Always switch off the phone and sound also is not good.
display is very good  quality is good  earphone is also good sound is not much but its ok call quality is good  the cyanogen gives lots options in yu yureka plus users of this phone definitely need a power bank .
Sound is loud and also full hd.good sound  9
Very Good Sound Systems with Equalizer options   More BASS System.
not good   I have returned with in a week   thanks to amazon  picture quality very bad  sound also not goodDon t order it battery is very poorHeating problemsBack speaker quality is very poorBokasGetting heat up very soon  also showing error in connecting WiFi few times and I have to restart the phone.
7  lastly sound clarity is awesome with inbuilt  AudioFX  which provides amazing sound while using Headphones like sKallcandy  Sony EtcCons  1  seriously guys YU has done a blander mistake of giving 2500mh battery for such large disply it drains quickly.
has good sound quality on speaker and earphones too.
I liked the following features I have used yet No hangingFast responseNice lookCameras are awesomeSpeaker jack is very nice Sound Quality is also nice.
i am using the same sim in another phone then sound is loud but in this phone the volume is low.
It is the best sound I have ever heard on a mobile.
9000 main aur kya chaahiyeits future technology smart phone screen quality is very good battery is very good sound its amazing.
Not meeting my expectations as facing low sound volume issue from the second party.

cyanogen os  7
For this mobile The OS mentioned are 1  Cyanogen OS   2  Android OS  v4.
but when I change theme cyanogen to android that time video recording sound clarity is totally bad and sometime hang.
Getting hot while talking or using 4g  touch sensitivity not up to mark  Camera just an average  cyanogen os need to improve more  contacts always crashing.
4  This mobile not having complete features of cyanogen OS  which are present in One plus One mobile.
i heard so much about the cyanogen os but it s just hype.
Now some interesting things maybe a little technical   but its  the only Indian phone within 10k running cyanogen mod which can be told one of the best android os skin currently and cyanogen mod does not have many bloatwares pre installed apps which cannot be removed like Samsung phones have many Samsung apps pre installed which cannot be removed.
4  As always cyanogen is really good.
Cynogen is awesome I realy think to buy every phone with cyanogen OS only  realy nice.
Those things aside  the Yureka Plus runs on the tried and tested Cyanogen OS which comes with a lot of customization options and security features  compared to other smartphones in the price range.
Pros 1  Already installed games and many applications no issues yet  Runs perfect fine2  Best in prices range  have used other phones in this price even more priced  this phone is handling the best3  Cyanogen OS 12  is the best OS you ever experience in this range phones  visuals are like high range phones4  64 bit processors  no there phones gives similar spec in this range not according to my knowledge.
Best this is the cyanogen mod 12 os   u get really good customizations options.
Battery is optimized well by cyanogen so that it can give same back up as that of yureka  even for full HD screen 6. chargering is faster because of 1.
I m placed an order on 11th oct   my estinated delivery date is 20th but surprisingly i got it on 14th oct. packeging is goodNow coming to mobile  it is good mobile with great cyanogen os out of the box.
--------------------------------------------------------
gaming  -7
Battery LifeIf you are not crazy about gaming and don t stay in internet or apps for so much time  this is not going to be a issue.
Camera is good   it heats while gaming   not much to burst or anything but i ll say it is ok because gaming is never compromised .
stable gaming  music and video playback Cons  Battery is not adequate 5.
6 hours with moderate gaming and wi.
the rest is more than enough for multi tasking and heavy gaming.
It gets heating while charging and with little gaming.
sometimes heat up due to excessive gaming otherwise its cool.
Battery is very weakHeat like anythingWorst Gaming experienceSoftware performance is good .
--------------------------------------------------------
in low light  -6
Not very convincing under low light.
so that picture comes clear and natural   low light picturing is also improved.
9 fps in low light.
In low light  and in night it does not take any photo.
In indoor lighting and low light pictures get grainy.
Camera is good in when there is enough light  back camera is bad in low light worse than front camera.
Everything other than heating issue is goodGood with some unbearable drawbackcamera with flash in low light gives poor outputbattery drain fastadaptive brightness not smoothly functionigWrote Battery and Network.
Do n t buy YU company phone  phone memory and construction is very good but it s battery backup is very worst and 13 mp camera as looking as  a chinese 5mp and in low light and flash it is very worst picture quality.
Front cam is very good and you also can use screen brightness to click selfies in low light.
You need steady hands to shoot in low light  and the pictures come out great.
--------------------------------------------------------
viewing angles  5
The viewing angles are great  colour reproduction accurate  and overall a great experience.
The viewing angles are great.
Great camera  and great viewing angles  .
This is a very nice display  which is able to reproduce true to life colours  sharp contrast and also offers great viewing angles with minimal colour distortion at extreme angles.
--------------------------------------------------------
hours to charge  5
After four hours of full charging it stay for not more than 6 hours if used for some 30.
Amazon delivered within 24 hours  It was really great.
Front camera very nicePoor battery backupHeats little much but it manageable for meSome key features missing13MP working not as Good I think9000 is a good priceThat s why I buy thisProcessor is also not too fast that I thinkLook wise not so goodTakes 4 hours to full charge that irritated meYU is a new company still have to learn a lotThanku hopes this review helps youNot able to give less than this.

better way you throw your phone under truck or burn it instead waiting cs or call from yu cswaste of moneyBattery is very bad need to charge for six hours n last for only 4hours.

This is just the first few hours of use review.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  4
Within 15 minutes of first time usage  downloading essential apps and syncing the phone over wifi the phone gets pretty hot as if i was playing some high end game for half an hour on my moto xGood Work by Yu Yureka   Phone is working fine with no problems at all.
Thereafter  I tried to disable certain Apps  clear space by deleting Cache etc.
However  intense gaming on apps like Asphalt 8  Front line commando does heat this device to permissible levels.
I want to laugh when it comes to the gaming experience on this phone on the amazon phone description the gaming experience is utterly exaggerated  I tried to play temple run 2 and subway surfer but during times the gameplay hangs and it would be frequent and heavy if you having background running apps.
Low sound and sensor doesn t work properly  when you are talking the screen turns on and opens calender  or other apps.
The worst mobile ever I installed about 30 apps it cannot handle that apps also it hangs again and again.
Fi was left on owing to which certain Apps got auto.
I do not expect it to perform any better after installing any apps.
It heated for no reason and lagged on some basic apps like dialer and messaging.
coz it has gorilla glass 35. dual sim  4g but i havnt used 4g yet 6. in short a mini mobile computer  if google apps fulfills ur purposes 7. ok camera.
After installing few apps free Ram is only 800 mb but same  number of apps in my Yuphoria and it have 1.
5 inch disply  4  no lagging issue till now by opening multiple apps  5  front cam is average  6  RAM optimization much better than the other device available Ram is 765 mb lenovo k3 available free Ram space is 300mb after  installing the basic apps.
I even tried removing unwanted Apps and disabling the notification options of the Apps but still its of no use.
I keep killing unused apps running in the background.
Doing this will ensure that your heating issue will reduce considerably to a manageable one  obviously once u install new apps you have to do the same stuff again for new ones.
Excellent Phone for users who use cell for basic apps like internet n photo editing shopping etcCamera quality excellentI bought this about 3  months back.
If by mistake u connect a different charger  ur phone will act weird  all apps open up and close automatically  touch screen wont work  music player wont work  etc.
No lags at all while using browser or any other apps.
As others mentioned  it hangs a lot even without much apps running.
Phone heating problem even during initial application installation Ram is over 50  utilized even with basic apps running.
The animations switch at a slightly slower rate and apps also take slightly longer to switch when compared to the original Yureka.
no basic APPS.
all apps are taking too slow to open .
same error facing in other apps to.
Allowos us to access most of its memory  like very basic Apps are pre.
--------------------------------------------------------
worth  -4
so i would say its a worth phone if you are ok with the battery.
Yureuka can still make some improvements with the camera quality however in all its a worth buyUnbearable heat.
mobile worth fr the price they r offering n delivery of amazon is too good.
no 1 online site amazon how they promote this kind of worth less and quality less phones.
--------------------------------------------------------
proximity sensor issue  -4
once call ll disconnected dat tim it ll show miss call listsThis Is a worst mobile when i had to purchased this mobile the sensor is not working properly and it s  produce very heat so better don t buy this mobile.
That is the case with most android phones 2  There was a small proximity sensor issue which caused the screen to go black on incoming calls.
Guys everyone are complaing about the heating problem and screen going blank proximity sensor issue .
It s astonishing to know that a mobile these days in this price range doesn t have such a vital   useful sensor.
After opening the pack what all I find is a third class product by Yu  Screen blacks out during incoming outgoing call so can t answer  disconnect any call  proximity sensor  touch charging speakers don t work  sim contacts invisible  hangs frequently   I don t really know what works in this phone.
The proximity sensor not working from day 1 searched the web to find that a lot of people have the same issue and there is no support from yureka.
There are however minor bugs here and there such as proximity sensor.
UPDATE NEEDEDIt is a nice phone which fulfil all your needs no issues yet it s been 7 days since I got the phone delivery was also average and must buy at this priceplease dont buy this chinse product which is not at all reliable  i am yureka user and facing proximity sensor issue.
Mega Pixel does not matter  2MP   full HD  need a better sensor.
I am really surprised after seeing the issue with the proximity sensor.
--------------------------------------------------------
calls  -4
For every question you ask them will keep you on hold for 1 min to answer and at last calls end with no solution.
As the processor is below the ear piece it is very difficult to attempt calls.
Heats up too quickly   especially using 3G or while making calls which is not good.
No service centres locally and u don t get called back even after several calls and emails.
I never seen in any mobile such a serious heating  problem and poor battery performance and not shown incoming calls proper.
Incase you use phone mostly on speaker mode for calls or you are ok to use a thick book case flip cover then u can manage to use with less impactBought this phone with all this hype around.
--------------------------------------------------------
times a day  -3
Some times touch is not responding.
No screen on several times when incoming call received.
It heats too much some times its impossible to hold it.
The phone has considerable lag and at times it is really irritating.
Good Customer service by Amazon I must say Design went wrong with some basic things like the music continues when the phone rings  so at times it becomes difficult to make out if the phone rings .
a. I have got the message  UI stopped unfortunately  several times.
Some times i wonder  is it a human being on another end  or is it a robot who is programmed to answer every thing as  wait for 3 more days Sir because i have been calling for over a month to hear the same answer from the Yu Yureka customer service team.
for for better or nothingi really hate this product it got 3 times replacement due to bad quality inspection from manufacturer and main drawback is over heating and bad proximity function in all three phones dont buy this by seeing this cool spec you will suffer after buying thishttps www.
In a day i have to formte the setting muiltiple times so thet it works fine.
Apart from heating problem  one more major issue I m facing is very poor battery backup  not even lasting one full day and now from latest OS update in Nov phone is automatically restarting many times every dayWhen u Locked the phone an any one call you.
Fi speed6 Cons  Can  Yu  suggest something to improvise rectify 1  The Phone heats up too often  at times  it becomes difficult to hold the Phone near the Ears2  Battery drains if you use Net or heavy applications3  The Back Cover and internal body look a bit fragile.
I complainted many of times as possible.
need to charge the mobile 2 times a day.
3 times full chargethe phone gets heated when u play heavy game or application or use it for 20.
SEVERAL TIMES I CONTACTED MICROMAX CUSTOMER CARE .
6 Camera is as well disappointing as it does its best at all the times snapping of pics.
--------------------------------------------------------
for yu yureka  3
First the buttons for volume and power are not good in Yureka Plus.
Verdict Expect for battery yureka delivers in every way look feel performance and custmization optionsIf you are OK with charging twice in a day but need everything else go for it won t dissapointBefore buying this product read yu yureka mobile riviews.
its really worth for our money and camera clarity is excellent when u compare to other phones and especially sound quality is far better and u will feel that it s really one of the best mobile under 10 K. if you compare with any other mobiles under 10 K with all these future Yu yureka is One of best mobile in india Market.
no phone will perform as good as the yureka plus.

service by amazon  3
He was unlucky as he could not return it to Amazon.
So  dear amazon  I m bring up the question one more time.
but am complain amazon but they are not take any action1.
However  I would like to thank the amazing Amazon Customer care  who took my request and were able to undertake the return of the Phone.
I am happy to go with Amazon.
in   Customer experience and service quality of Amazon are always good   I will give 4.
that is not good thingIt has average camera and bad gaming my device didn t play FIFA Maybe that is defective but Worst experienceIts a good phone and as usual amazon services are the best.
I just loved itgood performance about device and great  service by amazonnot good product of this yureka lot of problem in mobile every time its hangingIssues  phone is too slowPhone get heat early2 GB ram but of no useAll is okay .
cyanogenCon s  1. battery was draing quickly   I would be better if it was 3000 mAh batteryI have purchased this item from amazon but not opened for about 20 days than i opened the product and used than i came to know that it is heating very much and amazon is not taking it back saying that we have return policy of only 10 daysI have used this phone for two days and returned to Amazon.
Beside this  service by Amazon is great on time delivery and considerate  packing for electronic goods.
It was my first experience with Amazon  but was really great.
I am disappointed that amazon allowed this company to sell their phone on their site.
phone hang same with mi3 even the heatingCemara not good and phone super heater and no battery back up my suggestion to my friends don t buy this mobile because with battery backup there is no use with mobileMy Yureka plus rear camera not working I want to return but nobody responsible for receiving phone or refund my amount  this is really very bad service by yu or amazonI had purchase yureka plus there will be  problem issueing  when I was charging of my mobile then too much heating problem and hanging also kindly any give us solutionVery beautiful and highly configuration mobile so i very love very much this product.
Excellent service by amazon  the product is really very good bt only one problem that it heats up very quickly.
Also  last but not the least  the delivery service by Amazon is also awesome.
mobile worth fr the price they r offering n delivery of amazon is too good.
don t buy this As usual  Amazon s customer care services is excellent and 10 starts for it it hits too much at the processor level and also doesn t meet the clearity of camera also the battery doesn t full.
ravas service by amazon nice product for college student as well as working professionals.
Quality of the product is very bad  Manufacturing defect  and bad part is that Amazon is not able to replace it .
I bought this mobile through Amazon Only.
U will surely get DISAPPOINTEDI am a fully satisfied Amazon customer for the YU Yureka Plus mobile phone.
Overall its a good budget bigscreen phoneThis phone looks good but when i tried using itCould not receive the calls as the screen goes blank and there is no way to pick the incoming callSome times even the phone is not used and in idle state  people calling are getting a busy toneWhen we did reset the configuration  phone become too hot where you cannot even hold it in your handPhone heats too much  Amazon Service was good but product very very poor.
Thanks Amazon for fast   easy return policyBrilliant Phone From YU.

in yu yureka  -3
First the buttons for volume and power are not good in Yureka Plus.
Dont  go for this yu yureka brand  i purchased yu yureka in last march month and from  the day one itself i am facing o many issues like very poor batter back up  its taking 10  to 12 hrs to recharge in full and it will drain out in 3 to 4  hrs of normal use and over heating is an issue that its very difficult to hold in hand or hold near to our ears  network issue is like we have make reboot this set 10 times a day to get normal use  software issue is also a never ending processes   i made so many complaint to this customer care department and every time they given a new registration number  my complaint No  are   1096295 and 108236  and every time they are giving some weird answers  most of the time when we call them they will hold our call min.
Good thing   you become a good yureka technician resolving all the problems.
First of all yu yureka is heating too much .
BTW my yureka plus is working very fine.
In fact  it fell down from a normal regular coffee table and i wonder why it break like this   I think it s better you tell the Yu Yureka guys to name the glass they are using  as infant   baby gorilla glass  because  based on the quality of the above said glass used by Yu Yureka and how it shattered  i think  a even a new born baby can scratch and break it.
YU yureka plus purchased by me is always getting heated  due to which it cannot even be put in your pocket as skin is irritated and it is unbearable.
I was able to buy Yureka Plus in the first sale.
and one more problem i am facing charging problem it 4 hour in full charge and some time 6 hours its not good for any mobile userworst 1UselessGud oneAwesomenot gudlove itNot badHoplessyu plusShandaeAwesomeAwesomeOwesomeLike itawesomeAmzon sukss and yureka double suksss they ll take 2.
Yes apps take longer time to open than they did on previous yureka but I dont think 1 sec difference is too much of a trouble Well that s all.
display gone in very first datEIts the best phone at this price coupled with CyanogenMod  but due to heating issues it lags a bit  have downloaded the CpuTemp app to monitor  the temp always been 10 degree C more as compared to Yureka for same working   operating condition.
But then I inserted my battery in some other YUREKA phone.
I can t see who call me  how I accept call Yu Yureka plus in 9K its a good phone with  good build quality but the service support is very poor.
Verdict Expect for battery yureka delivers in every way look feel performance and custmization optionsIf you are OK with charging twice in a day but need everything else go for it won t dissapointBefore buying this product read yu yureka mobile riviews.
Sony cam sensor  Yes its pretty decent taking two photos on both yureka and moto g3 i noticed that photos taken in yureka had more contrast and saturation but it was partly due to the better screen in yureka  on a computer both looked equally good  yu g3.
my view buy yureka product only after they provide service centre in your cityAs usual like yu yureka  yu yureka plus is also having the same annoying problems.
In my new Yureka Plus  I can t able to download updates it takes hell lot of time.
If not overwhelming  delta changes can be observed when compared to the regular Yureka.
l had received these informations from the other yureka customers JOJI ABRAHAMYes  i am having a good experience of cynogen in YU yureka plus  its a good phone in budget.
If you find comfortable to charge the phone twice a day then its perfect for youYu Yureka plus is available with best futures in low cost compared to other brand.
3GHz Quad Core 16GB ROM 2GB RAM 13MP CAM Android KitkatI found it better then YU Yureka Plusur time is well bcz u r not foolish   first use this mobile from anybody brought then say me ur opinion .
overall good product at this price Battery Back up is very poor if you charge it in morning 7 AM it will not with you even 5 PMIs yu yureka plus supports fast charging feature   As its lacking in original yureka phone.
Otherwise awesomeGood Phone  better camera than original yureka.
Its a okay phone on this price range happy with the amazon DeliveryVery bad products phone heat like a sun n bettry draing very fastAfter 9 days of purchasing it stop working aur phir chalu hi ni huaSirf dekhna ye h ki lasting kitna din jata hai otherwise best phoneNot as per expectation it is better to have YU yureka earlier phoneBhot heng ho rha h. Aur apne aap turn off hoke turn on ho ja rha hSuper phone.
its really worth for our money and camera clarity is excellent when u compare to other phones and especially sound quality is far better and u will feel that it s really one of the best mobile under 10 K. if you compare with any other mobiles under 10 K with all these future Yu yureka is One of best mobile in india Market.
The animations switch at a slightly slower rate and apps also take slightly longer to switch when compared to the original Yureka.
Then i tried to charge some other s YUREKA Phone battery in my phone.
Now coming to the product  First of all there s no way to identify if its Yureka or Yureka Plus other than the writing on the cover of the box.
YU yureka plus has really done a major improvements over earlier YU yureka in terms of1.
Very stylish and good lookingYU yureka mobile screen digitizer Brocken during charging I required replaced the same please replaced it I pay these priceHey YU  i am not able see file manager in menu bar please help me I cannot access many of my important file the   thank yuoA decent phone for it s price.
gaming performances is also good  the yureka  gives value for the money overall the phone worth for buying  8999 .

customer service  3
Shameful Customer Service  My device stopped working within a year I submitted it to Service Center they uninstalled the update   returned the  phone You are NOT solving the Problem You are removing the PROBLEM I submitted my device for replacement it took a whole month   They gave me a USED device which was in WORSE condition than my phone ever would be even if I keep that aside the device couldn t charge  I have submitted it AGAIN.
2  Heats up like fire3  Restarts when using heavy apps4  Poor voice quality when speaking on phone  Opposite party can not hear my voice and their voice is being echoed 5  Not worth the price6  Customer service is horrendous and poor  MD of YU  do not try to take everything online  you can not serve customers virtually I am highly dissatisfied and will not recommend this phone to anyone.
good phone of 9kThe worst customer service of YUIt s GOOD.
Worst mobile and worst customer services.
Plus you have the ultra pathetic customer service to deal with.
Good Customer service by Amazon I must say Design went wrong with some basic things like the music continues when the phone rings  so at times it becomes difficult to make out if the phone rings .
Battery heatingup and very poor customer services.
but amazon service is superb amazon service and customer service is tooo good.
This Phablet is For youHello Guys Good Evening I requested you all please don t purchase any yu company Mobile very poor customer service  because in April i have purchase yu yureka just 4 ya 5 days ago my data cable don t work my data cable is in under warranty  i continuously calling yu customer care they can t give any proper replay yu company s after purchasing service is very very poor.
this mobile phone have very big big big problem i hate this mobile phoneVery good phone but slight issues overall been a great phone for a yearvery poor please don t buy this and on top of it worst customer serviceBattery heating and fast draing problem.
and worst customer service provided by YU team.
no proper customer service in India.
go for it   Its worth for all ur moneySo far so good in particular  the navigation bar adjustments  and clock adjustments superb  i think it is because of cynogenat first it has some minor app issues after update all the application in the play store seems it is good now  extraordinary music effects  superb video qualityexpecting the OS update toowith wifi usage phone keep 4 to 5 hours backupif you use WIFI  Mobile DATA  GPS  all the features then gone in two hour to extend your battery life switch off the features that is not need after a long search  i found a settings under display adaptive brightness  use lot of power once i turned off  seems the battery extends it s lifeAsphalt 8  have some lag on some particular maps and cars in particular some high end cars  this means need more processing power  but for a phone with this price it s ok have some minor bug in messaging app  you are not able to easily pick numbers from your contactswho the hell say that it has a poor customer service to me there is problem in a my ear phone send a mail and tell the details of my phone once the problem is identifiedwith in five days the replace with a new oneDo not buy this  You ll repent in few days.
Whatever the price advantages offered  it s not worth going through the uncertainty in even basic quality and absent customer service.
Very bad customer service after sale.
the customer service is really awesome but the end product is of no use and the efforts of the amazon executives go in vain.
YU Customer service is also pathetic.
scustomer service double bulls.
Amazon  what i want to ask is that  what shall i do  They don t have any service center  they don t have the parts  they don t have a proper customer care system  and even if I asked them that i will pay to repair they don t even have a single person in there to respond.
The only option they gave me was to Flash my Phone with some Software  as good as a Factory Data Reset  that wipes off all data  Am gonna visit the nearest  Authorized Service Centre  to try and get it rectified as a last resort  unless someone suggests an option in the interim  otherwise  as told by the Customer Care Personnel  I ll get my handset changed.

games  3
K3 note lag while playing heavy games.
i do play games but not high graphic games.
Sometimes i feel it gets heated while playing games otherwise it is still idle mobile for all categoriesNothing new.
it willl be superrrYureka plus is the best phone in this range but it also had heating problem like on playing heavy games   GTA SANDREAS  etc Hi.
I never play intense games.
Good phone But gets heated up quickly if you play heavy games and some light ones like clash of clans too but overall its a good phone.
Use some app for managing ram for decreasing heat issues during and after playing heavy games.
For those who play less games K3 Note is great.
Gaming is nearly impossible because as soon as gaming heats up the processor to such a degree that it starts to thermal throttling and fps drops it has trouble running even very basic games.
Now coming to what can be done in this device  first upon immediately receiving the device  enable privacy options to all by default  then go to advanced privacy settings and make sure all apps  except the ones that we really need   use often whatsapp  gmail  playstore etc  that need not be i. e games occasionally used apps etc and disable Auto Start and keep awake.
or I say much faster when u even play games like coc .
It struck during playing small games also.
And then there s the heating issue  the battery heats up while playing simple games such as Candy Crush.
Processor  can play high graphic games with no lags and frame drops can handle multitasking undoubtedly.
There is a considerable lag even while playing not so graphic intensive and heavy games like subway surfer and candy crush.
But in other games it works ok.
heat problem is present only when playing large games but in usual use is normal battery charging is slow   taking 3 hours   but after one week decreases to 2.
if u compare k3 note with yureka plus i agree that k3 note is quite fast than yureka but  it also heats up and wnhem uh are playing heavy games like asphalt 8  gta.
Its never lag while playing a heavy games.
Great performance in the sense that while playing large games it will not stuck at all.
For god sake don t play any high graphic games .
Device will heat up while playing heavy games   disply is great but only problem is the battery.
when playing games it hangs  Real Racing 3 is what i want to quote .
But gets overheated frequently while playing heavy games and multitasking.
who usually plays very high graphic games.
Gaming remains good  though now frame rate drops are more evident on games like Dead Trigger 2.
--------------------------------------------------------
temple run  2
temperature reaches 60 degree C. After 15 mins of Gaming  temple run  temperature shoots to 55.
I am not a big fan of gaming on mobile phone but when my daughter plays  temple run  on it for 10 minutes its pathetically hot to hold.
Gaming performance is very poor I can t play temple run and subway surfer  a very cheap device can play this games.
I want to laugh when it comes to the gaming experience on this phone on the amazon phone description the gaming experience is utterly exaggerated  I tried to play temple run 2 and subway surfer but during times the gameplay hangs and it would be frequent and heavy if you having background running apps.
--------------------------------------------------------
need to charge  2
I was able to delink them if need.
phone has dialer issue backup issue and the phone is not having proper camera as need to be in with flash their is serious issueThe product is very good.
Now I am satisfied with yurekaPacking need to be improved.
So much heating problem battery is so poorI need to buy a powerbank now.
better way you throw your phone under truck or burn it instead waiting cs or call from yu cswaste of moneyBattery is very bad need to charge for six hours n last for only 4hours.
Anyone help me hw to make conference call in yurekaIt s very bad phone heating problems hang ging alsobattery charge reduces even in the absence of usageAll features r gud bt battery backup is too bad whyIt s amazing  It s fabulousI like it totallyheating more then normalsound quality is badExcept the battery back up everything is excellentAwesome  Phone in best price with best features  this phone is a hellcontonuous heating issueDisplay clarity is very bad no need to spend 10000no deliverNice phoneHello Amazon  this is for kind appeal for you from my side   don t introduce and encourage such a mobiles from u r website  .
--------------------------------------------------------
service center  -2
More over  I came to know that there are no authorized service centers or personnel for  Yu Yureka any where in kerala.
just imagine without mobile service center how you think to buy yu yureka mobiles.
good product as of now no compliant about it but i am not able to find service center in mangalore  as micromax denied to accept this phone for service.
my phone isn t getting charged since last one month moreover these yureka guys dont have service center worst service.
I have heard from many of my friends that they had a terrible service experienced at Micromax service center.
Service center is horrible .

lenovo k3 note  2
For those who play less games K3 Note is great.
However  people who like simplicity must go forK3 Note as its VIBE UI is very simple to use.
considering K3 note is slightly higher2.
Although The Battery Is Low Powered As compared to Lenovo K3  but its better than bearing High SAR value that has a lot of radiations.
if u compare k3 note with yureka plus i agree that k3 note is quite fast than yureka but  it also heats up and wnhem uh are playing heavy games like asphalt 8  gta.
Based on the price i feel its best phone available right now and i feel its better than Lenovo K3 Note.
5 inch disply  4  no lagging issue till now by opening multiple apps  5  front cam is average  6  RAM optimization much better than the other device available Ram is 765 mb lenovo k3 available free Ram space is 300mb after  installing the basic apps.
but the fact is the camera quality of yureka is far far better than k3 note.
Lenovo K3 Note is doing good with the same Airtel 4G SIM.
--------------------------------------------------------
No hanging  2
don t even purchase dis phonehanging prob n blinking is common problong term used is producing heatso never think to take dis mobTrust me guysI was the biggest fan of yu yureka plus phonebut just I bought itbutphone hangs a lotn no battery backupI am facing problem in the battery It is draing too fast.
It is value for v money with some setbacksIt hangs a lot Especially the dialer and no improvements despite sending error reportsBattery back up is not great.
--------------------------------------------------------
update  -2
Heating issue is there but I think it will go with next update.
Should be recovered in the next update.
Overall I LOVE THIS PHONEWell i have heard people saying it has heating issues and it does but it is expected next update will solve this issue.
Some people have complained about a bluish tinge in their photographs  but the recent update has fixed it.
Adding further to the above update  the call center support staff says that I would have to wait 24 to 48 working hours that means 2.
Hope yu provides an update for all these as soon as possible.
Good phone  9k some os issue is but they promised that they will fix the issue in latest update over all it is very decent buyVery rubbish camera quality battery backup is also very bad and also dissipate The Heat you can make  egg omelet easily on itHad this serious heating issues.
But this update is not publicly available.
But the recent update  CyanogenMod  has reduced this to a large extent.
Kinda have glitches which will be corrected in next update .
1 came update to my mobile I just downloaded but there is no option to install it .
Hope the bugs get fixed in next update.

Battery drains quite fast.
Battery drain is very high.
but the lag on the phone is not so smooth UI  heating issues whenever u multitask and the battery drains so fast that it has to be on charge all the time.
Weak battery  Starts draing soon.
Also i find the battery is getting drained too quickly.
Everything other than heating issue is goodGood with some unbearable drawbackcamera with flash in low light gives poor outputbattery drain fastadaptive brightness not smoothly functionigWrote Battery and Network.
there s a heating problem and charging takes place slowly and charging reduces even if cell is not in useHeating problem is too much  Battery drains out very quickly  call ringer profile needs attention  over all my money is wasted it seems.
Battery drains faster than it was described expected.
Sometimes Battery also gets drained quickly in these scenarios.

Battery drains very fast and does not last a day if used for a few hoursMinor heating issue.
Other than that I am not happy with Battery life  but later I analyzed and smart phone of bigger screen size will have the same issues  but not as like this phone battery drains.

Second  the battery drains way too fast even when its not being used.
Mobile battery is draing quickly.
Legs too much battery drains quiccklyGreat mobileHeavy heating issuesNot goodBattery drain fastNot a good deal.
An Indian product having sizzling features that can even compete with phone like oneplus Xiomi in all sort of hardware and software specs Cyanogen allows to handle the phone in a friendly way Yu Yureka plus Go for it Great service from AMAZON Everything is fine except poor battery and heat     What is the benefit of HD screen or good hardware if you can t play with it for a while without charging and burning your fingers  It is good gadget but is certainly not a good mobile device as you have to sit near a socket to enjoy it   SADDD   Battery drains like a glass of water.
Even without Internet browsing battery drained full charged battery  gives only 12 to 14 hoursGuys please don t buy this phone.
Nice phone but battery was very poor and used to drained very fast.
7  lastly sound clarity is awesome with inbuilt  AudioFX  which provides amazing sound while using Headphones like sKallcandy  Sony EtcCons  1  seriously guys YU has done a blander mistake of giving 2500mh battery for such large disply it drains quickly.
The battery also get drained quickly.
battery drainsworking good but processor got hot during use.
Pros  screen clarity  ram  internal memory space camera both front n backCons  charging  heat emitted when we are using mobileThis phone heats up too much and the battery drains like 1  in every 2 mins.
do not see its specification its hardware is very bad camera not good  heating of phone up to 53 degree battery drain very fast and its customers care always give you one solution for these problem go for factory reset  so my suggestion do not buy such bad product1.

experience  -2
Phone gets hang also very bad experience so far Battery backup is not up to the level as expected.
It was a frustrating experience to buy it is a good product i buy it in 9999 and two month later 1000 gift card came becoz it price down after next day when i placed orderVery bad .
The experience has made me sad.
worst experience.
OVERALL A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THIS HANDSET.
On 10 if I had to rate this phone it will be 2 out of 10. very bad experience and now the phone heats up to 72 degrees within few min.
I thought of sharing my pathetic and aweful experience.
Awesome Experience With Superb Camera Clearityvibration not working please tell the solutionA good quality phone in even good price range.
pros 1. big screen with crystal clear display with full hd experience 2. good experience with caynogen OS and all its advantages 3.
This is my first worst experience with Amazon.
and u can not touch screen   And customer care is worst experience.
I want to laugh when it comes to the gaming experience on this phone on the amazon phone description the gaming experience is utterly exaggerated  I tried to play temple run 2 and subway surfer but during times the gameplay hangs and it would be frequent and heavy if you having background running apps.
The viewing angles are great  colour reproduction accurate  and overall a great experience.
Very Very Very bad experience.
Overall as a customer it is a very bad experience for me.
Not pure android experience as it is Cynogen OS.
It looks like it going to be blast that much heatingI naught this phone three days beforeMy overall experience is very goodOnly drawbacks are1 average Canara quality2 heating issue3 battery drainI have recently bought yureka plus from amazon.
an awesome experience.
It can only be used while using earphones  and the experience is awesome.
Therefore I will be judging based on my past experience.
It was very disappointing experience for me.
Anyway the only good experience was the delivery time.
It was my first experience with Amazon  but was really great.
This experience was horrible.
Its gudAmazingamazingAwsome experience abt phone its rocksWorst phone ever.
great experience  proud to be associated with amazonTechnology is now cheaper even.
The cyanogenmod mod that comes with it is my favorite thing in the phone  it was easy to choose as i had very little things to like   but even  that had its fare share of bugs making the user experience less than enjoyable.
l had received these informations from the other yureka customers JOJI ABRAHAMYes  i am having a good experience of cynogen in YU yureka plus  its a good phone in budget.
I thought this would be an isolated case but again a week later I came to know of my colleague who is having the same experience with this phone which he purchased for his wife.
And an experience like this   just makes the belief stronger of not going for unknown brands   look at the experience I just had Sad Here is my review after the two weeks of usageI was really confused before buying this phone as I was also considering Lenevo  K3 Note as well.
I m having a amazing experience.
hadsoff yu and micromaxI loved the phone outlook camera if good but could have worked more on it  one major drawback is while charging the phone it gets over heated and also while playing games  sometimes phone gets slow and after it works fineExpected a wonderful experience but its performance is giving me a headache.
Hi all I am Venky actually I purchased this phone 7 days bk   from my experience its good but when I am operating phone it s take a second if am I doing an event little slow    and to charge the battery take 4 hours it comes around 7.
Trust me their service experience has been horrible.
I read many reviews regarding the mobile and experience by the other customers was also worst but i took risk in purchasing the mobile feeling that the bugs will be cleared in the upcoming updates but they didn t even give an update till date.
It s a very bad experience cell phone I ever had till today since it gets heat up while charging  playing normal game and Even while speaking over the call.
--------------------------------------------------------
in price range  -2
It tops among its competitors in the same price range.
Its a okay phone on this price range happy with the amazon DeliveryVery bad products phone heat like a sun n bettry draing very fastAfter 9 days of purchasing it stop working aur phir chalu hi ni huaSirf dekhna ye h ki lasting kitna din jata hai otherwise best phoneNot as per expectation it is better to have YU yureka earlier phoneBhot heng ho rha h.

Awesome Experience With Superb Camera Clearityvibration not working please tell the solutionA good quality phone in even good price range.
Best in price range.
when i buy this its price was 9 999 but nwit reduced to 8 999 its alose for me about 1000 hw can i regain thisPhone s sound is vibrating  speaker or the headset s sound is broken not audible I will be returning it Amazon2 problems is 1  heating 2  Camera quality could be better  but for this price range  it is excellent product.
Pros 1  Already installed games and many applications no issues yet  Runs perfect fine2  Best in prices range  have used other phones in this price even more priced  this phone is handling the best3  Cyanogen OS 12  is the best OS you ever experience in this range phones  visuals are like high range phones4  64 bit processors  no there phones gives similar spec in this range not according to my knowledge.
Hope YU comes with a better device within same price range.
For price range 10K it is OK to have.
Its acceptable in this price range.
CM 12 OS is the main reason I got this handset instead of Lenovo and other products in same price range.

When you make any calls or when incoming is going on screen become black and no command were working therefore unable to receive call or can not see who is calling.
Whenever you make a call the same repeated line comes we will arrange a call for you but no one cares to call.

2 gb ram  -1
2gb of free Ram.
2gb ram is huge for this phone.
I m unable to understand why my mobile is performing slowly as said it has 2 GB ram but its too slow even while typing also it heats the most and takes longer time to fully charged .
16GB memory and 2GB RAM is good enough that you get in the price.
Although it has a fancy 2 GB ram and a snapdragon processor but this mobile just hang while multi.
--------------------------------------------------------
android  1
OS   undoubtedly the best customized android os.
Charging takes a lot of time too The worst Android phone ever.

--------------------------------------------------------
lot of problems  1
This is also pure android too but because of the problems mentioned above I am discouraging the customer about it.
I have request to return back due to some other problems  mainly quality is bad as same as duplicate one.
Don t buy this phone toooo much problems in this .
good value for moneyGood phone with usual problems  poor battery backup  HeatingHeating problem with the phone.
but that problem alone is enough to cause a lot of other problems like short battery life  device up time and device life as well .
Frequent problems 1.
this mobile had lot of problems  above peoples written reviews not true.
In addition to the heating   battery drainage issues I am facing some irritable problems with my YuYureka  having android lollipop n cm12 .
usb problems  memory card problems also coming compre with this smasung is batter yureka is better then yureka plusVery very worst and waste phone.
Direct video calling not supportOnly video call with applicationPhone is awesome but only prblm is the phone get hit up while chargingExcellent phoneBest phone everHeating problemi bought 5010 yurophiya it was full  lot of new feature with very reasonable price but it has hanging problems i contact call center from july 26 to 23 august almost daily but they failed to solved problem than i took yureka PLUS 5510 and find it s audio and video quality very poor in compare to previous  5010 than i try intex aqua trend but it couldn t satisfied me as my expectation .
Having same problems with YU   like i had with yureka.
Some other problems are.
We faced similar problems with the white variant of the OnePlus One.
new new problems poppin up evrydy.
40 days  for which people need to avoid buying this phone  it s not long lasting and will not let you stay peacefully once you buy it  as you ll have to go round and round to meet the service center executives  it s not what a customer will like at all  Will you  I hope  no  so for sure I recommend not to buy this product  or amazon should extend it s return policy days as most of the phones are creating problems in it s early 30.
the phone has major problems with charging issues  phone hanging and rebooting.
I hate the phone there are some major problems first of all this device has battery backup of just 12 hours on standby so you need to charge even if u dont use it at all it heats up and heats up really bad really fast and I havent played any high end graphics .
Nice one  value for moneyIt get heats up very fastI got this mobile first and it had problem with the flash light  i got the mobile exchanged but now i have multiple problems with this mobileFirst the mobile gets very hot while you are talking and there is hot air which comes out near the speakers close to ur ears which is very annoying.
Nevertheless  this replacement itself broke down after 2 month with software issues   touchscreen problems  battery drainage fast  proximity issue  low call volume  voice at other end is not audible etc.
There are frequent problems with the proximity sensor when the screen turns black and you don t get to see who  is calling you.
I ve been using it for around 4 months and haven t yet faced much problems with the device.
Other than these problems  its a nice phone.
etcBut some little problems are coming in phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
software  -1
sound camera software are best in my knowledge.
We all know that just powerful hardware isn t enough to make a phone truly powerful  good software is also need.
The games are a bit lagging  I played stick cricket 2. its not a very heavy software though but still the game was lagging every ball.
I was not able to update the software itself as I cannot connect my phone to PC due to driver issues.
I really like its features but in software it not good.
Product is good as hardware point of view  very powerfull hardware at low cost but I am not satisfied with software performance it too much buggy and finally want to say that YU did not kept his promise to give new software update every month.
processing slow when compare with a116Ya the phones heating only while charging and rest features are very goodHi friends the phone was good and camera was very good the phone was goodCamera quality is not good also software is not at good it s hangs a lot.
After this I Upgrade phone to its original software version.
But the software is very unstable.
I hope YU will resolve all d issues with a software updateGot it from amazon on august.
Though there has some minor software issues.
20mins of usage nd the whole software is laggy.
The only option they gave me was to Flash my Phone with some Software  as good as a Factory Data Reset  that wipes off all data  Am gonna visit the nearest  Authorized Service Centre  to try and get it rectified as a last resort  unless someone suggests an option in the interim  otherwise  as told by the Customer Care Personnel  I ll get my handset changed.

gorilla glass  1
As my phone screen is full of scratches and even the GREAT Gorilla Glass.
Plus it also comes with gorrila glass 3  which is not top of the line anymore because gorilla glass 4 is out .
