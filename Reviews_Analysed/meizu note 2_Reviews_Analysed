mobile look and feel great  display is very good  touch is nice but coming at edges i try to type using key board at corners the touch is not working fine i am using form 11th aug i faced daily this touch issue camera super it is very fast witout any lag picutures are decent enough as of my observation battery is good but not that great mainly my device is getting heated even moderate usage like browsing  in call  and normal gaming my main problem heating.
Display is Quiet Very Good.
because the phone doesn t have a grip at the back  it is way too smooth so when you buy a cover make sure it has a back which is grippy it will prevent it from slippery situations and now the next thing is the delicate screen i managed to break mine though display is still intact but my glass is cracked completely because when you break it its a heartbreak when you look at that gorgeous piece of tech cracked it ll make you feel if you could go back in time and fix it and also that the screen costs half the price of the phone  one more small disappointment is that it doesn t come with earphones  and now for those who have xiomi and micromax as an alternative in mind  forget about those its not even worth comparing this powerful piece of beauty in tech outstands all just with these few drawbacks that are smooth back and a mildly delicate body but we do have solutions for those so yeah close your eyes and buy this phone  just say   Shut up and take my money      IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY U SPEND the links for certain suggestions i made.

Take it any hesitationWorst phone experience I have had  after accidentaly locking the phone with a pin code I couldn t unlock it any other way it didn t show the option of login using your google id and password after several wrong tries it couldn t be hard reset as even that asked for the same passcode could not be erased via google device manager as that also asked for the same passcode Overall was a good looking device for the price  decent camera and screen  Audio quality was horrid and lacked bass  the screen got a few micro scratches after just 2.

Very good product but pathetic and unreliable service.
Only single sim can be used if you want to use an SD card as they share the same slotMy judgement  For me  the pros clearly over weigh the cons of this phone  and thus its a worthy device Meizu m2 note s Camera quality is not good and phone gets warm instantly and lack of inbuilt FM  radio if require need to install app nd it works on internet.awesome mobile  32
The mBack button is a good addition to the device  being able to add a micro sd card is a boon.

Low Sound Output in Loudspeakers  but output quality is good.
sound quality is very poor.
Next  plug in your headphones   open the pre installed music app  go to settings    turn on Dirac HD sound   this should resolve the problems of poor sound output.
And the phone has a sound enhansment option just like in htc beats on off option.

Sound quality is also good.
Sound quality through external speaker is dull and slightly distorted at high volume levels.
Sound quality is nice and loud enough  I dont know why people are complaing of low sound  its perfect though .

The picture it takes is amazing  the specs  the front cam  especially  is amazing  and to add on to the awesomeness the battery and the 5V adapter charges the phone pretty fast even if u connect it to your computer and select the mode use  usb for charge only  the capacity of the battery is again amazing in this price range and not to forget the octa core processor never hangs with a moderately good storage of 16 gb i e internal we can add  upto 128 gb and  not to forget it also has an OTG support.

camera 8 10battery 7 10look 10 10resolution 9 10speed 9 10overall 8 10Nice phone looks good and usage also good I will recommend to buy this phoneActually I m not but this product but i saw it in YouTube  in this product dual sim s works sure but if u want to insert micro sd then micro sd take sim to slot so please check before u buy this product because sim 2 works micro SD and gsm sim so this is not dual sim phone if this is dual sim phone then there is no micro SD expendableLight weight phone with nice look from front  bad sound quality and camera.
lenovo k3 is alternative to this phone but premium looks are only appear in this phone.
Very nice phone in terms of looks  weight  speed  features  performance  etc.
looks are nice.
When i unboxed the mobile 1 The looks are just awesome with premium looks.
The chief difference is its powerful battery and great looks among all the features that all 3 phones have in common.
Very good in looks and screen to body ratio2.
looks stylish battery is good camera is good processor is good touch is responsive build up quality is great overall the device runs smooth and it is awesome.
Looks good in hand.
Looks good and premium for the price.
i like the phone its looks very nice and battery life is very good.

slot for memory  -8
My phone runs with few of of most memory hungry apps and games   games but still the touch response is really good  this would easily beat a phone with a 20k  price range.
2A version you have to just download the zip file and copy to your internal memory and then reboot yourphone to recovery mode by pressing volume down   power on key and then update it.
same slot for 2nd sim and card.
nice and crisp display for both conditions night and in direct sun lightPros  Amazing looks  Nice FHD Display  good battery life  amazing user interface  tons of featuresCons  slippery like hell Good cameraI am using lots of other devices but in this price range no one can beat the Meizu M2 notePhone is good but one major issue  as this is a dual handset two slot given but for memory card their is not separate slot given.
no separate memory slot.
The ram and the internal memory holds it back from the top.
Other features include smart gesture support  notification Led  dual tone led flash and very efficient memory management.
You can use either second sim or memory card in the second slot.
same slot for memory card and nano sim.
N awesom display n camera qualityMobile is very good but I need dual sim with external memory option that s why I can t purchase.
Hence it is not useful as dual handset as internal memory is only 16GB which is very less as per today scenario.
Falsely advertised as dual sim whereas its same slot.
Good phone with such features for 9999  but no separate slot for memory card.
the phone keeps the app open in memory  so the phone dosent have to run the app again.
no separate memory card slot.
one slot is common for SIM and memory card  some function key also not understanding   no back key   button .
First I thought  abt mi4i bt as mi4i is not expandable memory hence I switch to this one.
they have given two sims dual stadby and the memory int the same slot.

usage  -8
camera 8 10battery 7 10look 10 10resolution 9 10speed 9 10overall 8 10Nice phone looks good and usage also good I will recommend to buy this phoneActually I m not but this product but i saw it in YouTube  in this product dual sim s works sure but if u want to insert micro sd then micro sd take sim to slot so please check before u buy this product because sim 2 works micro SD and gsm sim so this is not dual sim phone if this is dual sim phone then there is no micro SD expendableLight weight phone with nice look from front  bad sound quality and camera.
mobile look and feel great  display is very good  touch is nice but coming at edges i try to type using key board at corners the touch is not working fine i am using form 11th aug i faced daily this touch issue camera super it is very fast witout any lag picutures are decent enough as of my observation battery is good but not that great mainly my device is getting heated even moderate usage like browsing  in call  and normal gaming my main problem heating.
some times lags on heavy usage  every phone lags I would imagine most people would not associate it with an Android Lollipop when they use it.
After several months of strenuous usage  it s running like ferrari.
Also need to charge twice a day for very heavy usage.
Heating issues with lesser usage will be sorted out with updates  lesser android custom features like no on screen notifications etc but overall flyme is fast and responsiveI will give 4.
Avoid this phone at all costs  incase your usage is heavy.
Battery usage on average 1 dayGood phone at cost of 9999NaveenMeizu m2 Note is an ecellent smartphone in its kind.
Now coming to the pros and cons of the device after one day of heavy usage.
It lasts upto whole day even after heavy usage.
Battery backup is superb like one can easily go for 1 and a half day with moderate usage.
Overall the device is decent but it heats up a lot with heavy usage.
Battery of Around 3 days with moderate Usage.
Have to admit that battery performance is truly phenomenal  It easily lasts the entire day with moderate to heavy usage on 4G N W with some juice still left.
Gets changed in 2hrs n lasts for 2days of moderate usage.
Brief summary  A great phone for the price Battery life  Great  Typically lasts an entire day with moderate usage.
double tap click is something interesting n new for usage.
It heats up with some heavy usage  starts lagging too much  hangs very often and irritates the hell out of you  ear phone volume is very low  screen brightness takes a beating under sun  removing or inserting Sim Card   SD Card is a painful task.

Only shortcoming is SD card and dual sim are mutually exclusive.
Looks good  no Hindi language if u want to insert memory card then only one sim can be used or u can say dual sim is optional one sim plus one sim  memory CardThis phone is great value for money and offers a great display  beautiful design and an above camera both front and rear.
Dual Sim nano but if u want to use micro sd card expansion then u sacrifice one spot6.
N awesom display n camera qualityMobile is very good but I need dual sim with external memory option that s why I can t purchase.

Single sim and memory card slot or dual sim.
Falsely advertised as dual sim whereas its same slot.
Only problem is dual sim problem and sd card that can t be used simantaneously.
There is only one sim card slot that you can use making it useless as a DUAL SIM phone since the other one you might want to put a Memory card.

It s a dual sim bt v can t insert SD card if u want to use SD card then u have to take out 1 sim from that .

--------------------------------------------------------
rear and front  6
All of them having 13mp rear and 5mp front but i liked M2 note detailing in both of the cameras but YU plus and K3 note have decent quality.
Rear  Camera quality is bad and is blur front is good battery is good but no FMThis fone is exellent.
But that doesn t mean rear camera doesn t justify its 13 MP.
Decent Rear camera  perfect front camera.
camara is ultimate good front and back.
The cameras both front and rear are good.
Gaming also heats upper front nd back of phone5 battery drains using internet.
Camera quality is nice and decent on both Rear and Front.

I have used many budget phones  but Meizu ranks as one of the worst value for money.
It is well and good  great phone go for itNice phn in 10k rangeBest quality productsgreat mobile  camera quality is very good  sharp display  working very fine value for money.
This mobile is very good complete value for money very soft touch good front camera but back poor camera.
I would rate it as super value for money.

sim sd card  5
The mBack button is a good addition to the device  being able to add a micro sd card is a boon.
Only shortcoming is SD card and dual sim are mutually exclusive.
No Two SIM card along with a Memory card possible  may need at times.
But the same SIM card when I put it into another phone itz OK.
But sim trey if their is 2 sims plus memory card slot means its quit awesome.
functioning wellPhone get heated up very fast UI average giving dull lookexcellent features amazing performance and stunning looksIf you use memory card  only single Sim card can be used.
Nice phone but one sim one card slot there may be saprate card slot with two SIM slotsAwesome design  light weight  good camra  good battery life.
Only the drawback is we can not use the second sim if we use the memory card.
battery very poorUseless phone with no dual sim option to be used with SD card.
Looks good  no Hindi language if u want to insert memory card then only one sim can be used or u can say dual sim is optional one sim plus one sim  memory CardThis phone is great value for money and offers a great display  beautiful design and an above camera both front and rear.
Great  smart  phone  guys great job m2seprate slot required for memori card.
I don t understand these people put so much things in a single phone but can t give a full SIM card slot.
You can t use dual sim and memory card at a time because try only made for dual sim card or sim memory card.
Single sim and memory card slot or dual sim.
display is awesome 1080p call quality is awesomebuild quality is one of the best smartphone in 10k rangeI loving itmust buygo for itno doubt the product was very good but Amazon people does not wrote the product is not working 2sim card Plus 1 SD card either 2 sim.
Only problem is dual sim problem and sd card that can t be used simantaneously.
You can use either second sim or memory card in the second slot.
VCF incompatable  and single sim slot with mem card slot  rest phone is just ok. Theek hai  good for people who are buying a really good phone in a good low costGood so far.
So if you wish to use a memory card then this is a single sim phone for you.
My friend brought it for 8500  15  discount in hdfc card after using it for 1 day and comparing it with mi3  i have a mi3 1.
Dual Sim nano but if u want to use micro sd card expansion then u sacrifice one spot6.
but only one sim and memory card is possible.
Only single sim can be used if you want to use an SD card as they share the same slotMy judgement  For me  the pros clearly over weigh the cons of this phone  and thus its a worthy device Meizu m2 note s Camera quality is not good and phone gets warm instantly and lack of inbuilt FM  radio if require need to install app nd it works on internet.
It s a dual sim bt v can t insert SD card if u want to use SD card then u have to take out 1 sim from that .
Only problem is dual sim problem and sd card that can t be used simantaneouslyVery good phone.

Looks wise it can easily beat iPhone 6 Plus   However   as one of the reviewers mentioned  I too face touch issues at the edges often.
For this device  I am using it for some time and no such issues so far.

Enjoying the features and Not much issues faced until now .
Best in class camera  superb IGZO display vid colour saturation  audio output amazing in headphone but little bit slower in speaker  but no issues  rear and front and front camera is amazing  capture stunning photos and what a look yr superb like iphone 5c 5.
No other issues whatsoever regarding performance camera both .
But I can t say it s perfect  I have found various issues with this device  FlyMe is not perfectly designed for international usage despite in China.

But the meizu m2 stands tall amidst the fight for the throne.
Good camera and battery life is more than a day with moderate useageExcellent phone in 10k I am satisfied with Meizu m2 note I think it s value for  money and less in budget also just go for it .
--------------------------------------------------------
software  3
Apart from phone s physical body its internal software is nice working.
Full Screen apps can be make into less than full screen and can use with other software  Videos and calc can be made to use partial screen  For eg  browsing through a site I can use a calc which is not full screen.
I am yet to hear from the Meizu customer support  seems like a terrible software glitch rest assured I will never buy or recommend anyone to get a Meizu device ever.
Bht bekaar or bkwaas h ye phnNo correct signal in the phone  always software is hang and the set is over heatingi bought this phone recently and im not able to sync my google contacts   any help Serious flickering issue.
However if you look closer the phone is packed with one of the best Software and Hardware features for its price.
I would like people to understand here that to bear software upgrade u must have speedy hardware that m1 has but unfortunately m2 doesnt.
hallo guys you also change international software Version 4.
Good Software i. e. Flyme OS.
Better to pay extra and buy standard priductsTerribly bad software on a decently for hardware.
Its recommended you read through the Software manual before using this or else you might end up bugged.
SmartTouch   This is a small trackpad like software which is similar to what iPhone has.

Meizu m2 noteJust worth every bit .
I feel happy to pay Meizu.
And sadly my white Meizu looks awful since its front bezel is black .
I was quite curious about Meizu since specification wise it seems like the best phone so here it is Real Hands On Review.
l like this mobilesound is disadvIt is good note phone with lowest priceno ear phones included.
You will not regret buying this productGood Job Amazon  kindly get other Meizu phones alsoCrisp displayAwesome batteryNice build qualitySmooth and nice musicAbove average camerasOnly con is hybrid sim slot.
But overall I love my Meizu mobile.
Looking good but hanging a lotI love this phone  everything is awesome  Meizu did a good innovation on this device.
But i think  we should encourage the M2 note because it is having all the requirements that a budget segment phone should have in it.
Good camera and battery life is more than a day with moderate useageExcellent phone in 10k I am satisfied with Meizu m2 note I think it s value for  money and less in budget also just go for it .
Meizu is not good as I expected it.
I am really happy  to got it  awesome phone awesome looks awesome performance everything is awesome but there is no headphones included i love this phoneSuperb smartphone in this price segment meizu m2 note completly beat lenovo k3 note overall performance  superior specification no hanging no lag give smooth performance.
I am using meizu m2 note since last 4 months  and I am pleased to tell you that it is a worthy phone.
on specification it s has given 3 days in 3G networkWell   let me start off by saying that this meizu m2 note is a good looking smart phone within its range.
I have been using Meizu M2  Note from last one week i am completely satisfied with product but problem is that when I put sim card in it it always shows no signal.
Pathetic  yeah you read it right  totally pathetic customer service  who really don t know anything about Meizu mobile feature .
and I love flyme OSNice phone very good display clearity superb Battery backup is very  good Thanx for Meizu very good smart phone launce   Thanx Tu Amazon superb smartphonethank you so much meizu and amazon for the wonderful device.
Good but mi is bestplay store not openmeizu m2 note awosmTruly an awesome phone at this price Well you are getting this word from a tech reviewer on YouTube.
for gaming k3 note is better than m2 note otherwse in every department meizu wins.
comparing to lenovo K3 note it is not that much good.
M2 note is awesome.
Meizu for such a classyy masterpieceProduct is NICE but its accessories is difficult to find.
I am using meizu It is good.
I am proud of meizu.
Sadly Meizu is not capable of it.
Expect some U I updates flame UI must be improvedBest mobile m2 note  is really goodWORTH FOR MONEY AND PROMT DELIVERY.
just love itDear sirThe Mobile Nexus M2 Note is not working since I started  using of the same.
I have used all of them and will say M2 note is the best of three.
means o common meizu go with micro dn i will surely recomendedit to other.
but gorilla cud have been betterCons1 loudspeaker output is not gd2 processor n gpu used shud had been same as m1 note as avid gaming players wud certainly check this very aspect3 camera takes pictures only in 14 3 dimension.
But the meizu m2 stands tall amidst the fight for the throne.

know why people  -3
Not much people will like the flyme launcher  I m using a custom launcher.

RegardsManish kumarone of the best phones in 10k i have been receiving a lot of compliments just for looks by the time i reach hardware specifications people ask where can they buy one  DScreen is amazing  light sensor sometimes dosnt work as expected but i dont care as that is not a feature which drives the whole experience  gestures work perfectly well  battery pulls through a day n half  Flyme is a delight compared to stock UI.

Such a bad experience I had never had itAmazing phone in this range and worth itIts a very good phone in Rs 10000 range.
Using 4G is a great experience in this phone.
Finishing of the device is very good and its looking awesome  the touch experience is smooth and touch response in incredible.
Indian firmware should be flashed  to get good experience.

--------------------------------------------------------
dead trigger  -2
No heating issue at all plus can run high end games with ease dead trigger  asphalt8  modern combat5 .
List of games that work smoothly on this phone  Clash of clans  candy crush  real racing 3  asphalt 8  dead trigger 2  nfs mw   dungeon hunter 4  top farm etc.
--------------------------------------------------------
viewing angles  2
Viewing angles are very good.
It packs a super crystal clear AMOLED Display of 1080p Resolution which gives me a brilliant color reproduction and fantastic viewing angles no distortion at all.
--------------------------------------------------------
sim and memory  2
You can t use dual sim and memory card at a time because try only made for dual sim card or sim memory card.
Single sim and memory card slot or dual sim.
functioning wellPhone get heated up very fast UI average giving dull lookexcellent features amazing performance and stunning looksIf you use memory card  only single Sim card can be used.
Looks good  no Hindi language if u want to insert memory card then only one sim can be used or u can say dual sim is optional one sim plus one sim  memory CardThis phone is great value for money and offers a great display  beautiful design and an above camera both front and rear.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  2
the transition between apps is smooth.
Performance is great  runs even the heaviest of apps and games smoothly.
It also comes with minimum apps  which gives you the option of truly choosing which apps you want.
No FM  No FB in built app and a lot of other apps are missing.
Really comfortable and silky to handle this phone with various apps.
2A you will have few unwanted chinese apps but you can uninstall them after getting flyme privilidges from flyme account settings   it is simply root your phone The best thing I have done recently is buying meizu m2 note.
It s not happening only for media players but also for other apps like Xender.
Remain item is very good apps working fantasticly but only one problem i. e. Battery back up.
Play store and other apps works finemusic   ringtone volume low.
Ability to close all open apps in one swipe7.
launch apps from scratch even when switching between recent apps.
You can use this to put the screen to sleep or browse through your recent apps or return to Home Screen.
Permission s change   This is an awesome tool which can be used to stop spawning of  battery hoggers   eg  facebook  and other apps which use a lot of unnecessary notifications.
I installed basic apps whats app  gaana  vlc  ccleaner  play music subway surfer  using play store .
Installed required apps on to the device battery drained to 10 .
back  rear  camera is really damn goodFront is also the same but it doesn t support facial recognition and fixConsNot a having an Android feel for the phoneFlyme os it s sucksThe recent apps not u think as it isMainly there not much accessories for this mobile Even back coverALTERNATIVE TO THIS MOBILE ISLENOVO K3 NOTEHi I bought this mobile for after my redmi note3G got speaker problem  compare to my redmi note 3G Its very higher in screen resolution Not heavy  custom settings Its simple to use  still now its working fine no issue  3 weeks used Most Like in this device1.
2  It has an inbuilt feature of app lock so no need to download any such apps.
many people think meizu hvn t back button or close those apps who running bt its wrong.
its open all apps who is runing and meizu does not ur 4g 3g data without ur permission bcoz in flyme u have a option lock autolaunch to apps like fb whatsapp and many more apps just chk meizu m2 note window a seurity section.

flyme os  2
The most pleasing  fluent and efficent Flyme OS Great display good camera strong build quality and also a pretty decent battery life.
Heating issues with lesser usage will be sorted out with updates  lesser android custom features like no on screen notifications etc but overall flyme is fast and responsiveI will give 4.
The flyme OS is Also i enjoyed a lot Guys  Its very hard to tell its Android device if u see the graphics  Flyme seems to have taken a lot of inspiration from iOS  they copied a lot so its a Mix of Android and iOS9.
Flyme Os is also good.
I found Flyme OS to be very snappy and polished.
Da best part is flyme os.

I feel sad to bought this product  I m not satisfied with this product   thus the main reason is back cover of the phone is worthless  but looks gud  I does not have service centre in India low processor speed  otherwise good camera quality and good sound quality charge back up is very good  quick charge up.

amazing  -1
best phone under 10Ki think this is a oneplus  lternative  D as price of this mobile is too low when compared to specs nd design  Things i  love this mobile  Amazing camera qualityAmazing battery backupPremium designOne  home key with.
--------------------------------------------------------
back cover  -1
Display is bright and legible in sunlight tooCons Phone is slightly slippery due to the highly glossy back cover.
The built quality is average and it does look a little cheap when it has a Chinese branding on back cover but again compared to some phone below 10 k I must say that the built quality is great.
See the photos  how the screen guard was removed and replaced  Look at the Dent it has on the back cover  see the back protective plastic was cut.
--------------------------------------------------------
lenovo k3 note  -1
For eg  Lenovo K3 note  Yu Yureka Plus  which i have used before  thanks to my friends and cousins.
Better than K3 note and Redmi Note 2.
for gaming k3 note is better than m2 note otherwse in every department meizu wins.
comparing to lenovo K3 note it is not that much good.
I am really happy  to got it  awesome phone awesome looks awesome performance everything is awesome but there is no headphones included i love this phoneSuperb smartphone in this price segment meizu m2 note completly beat lenovo k3 note overall performance  superior specification no hanging no lag give smooth performance.
--------------------------------------------------------
overall  1
It is really good overall.
--------------------------------------------------------
update  -1
Click volume up and power button simultaneously and select Update option on the boot screen.
graet work i receiver softwer update.
it still has chinese language themes with no details of English update to the same.
--------------------------------------------------------
amazon  1
I m very much Happy for next Day Delivery from Amazon  but very much unhappy with the mobile.
Very nice n super I like it Amazon.
This phone gets heat up by normal use and the os of the phone is not niceMissed call outgoing incoming calls are on same screen and it hard to use ever messeanger also have this problemIF YOU ARE NOT GOID IN PHONES THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BUY THIS PHONEBAD PHONEpackaging amazon is not good.
Now am scared to take new product from Amazon   to be frank I was planning to purchase Coolpad note 3.
--------------------------------------------------------
fm radio  -1
FM radio is not available.
--------------------------------------------------------
low light  -1
And has great low light capability compared to the k3 notePerformance wasnt my choice anyway.
Excellent performance in daylight   acceptable performance in low light   by acceptable here I mean better than the most budget phones 3.
low light photograhy is also good.
Pros Crisp displayTouch s very goodVery gud cameras both front n back s gudD hot key option s gud back button Decent speakerNo lags or hangs really osmFeels gud in hand n nic fair designBattery backup s decent tooCons No headset includedWriting this review after 1 week use the battery backup is awesome the feature of the phone is very good there is some problem in camera in low light phone having nice display and good processor nice 2GB RAM and very good OS fly mepowered by Androidi have a problem iam sending msg but why sendng fail not working msgsIt s the best phone for its price range.
both front and rear produce very good quality pictures in proper lighting and so so in low light.
RegardsManish kumarone of the best phones in 10k i have been receiving a lot of compliments just for looks by the time i reach hardware specifications people ask where can they buy one  DScreen is amazing  light sensor sometimes dosnt work as expected but i dont care as that is not a feature which drives the whole experience  gestures work perfectly well  battery pulls through a day n half  Flyme is a delight compared to stock UI.
Pictures are not exactly sharp in low light but they are better than most cameras I have seen on phones of these range or even higher.
In low light pictures are grainy however you are able to lock on the objects quite fast.
rating it 4 satrs bcoz the camera in low light is not impressive.
Worth for the money what we have paidSome Chinese bloat ware   cheap errors like spelling mistakes in the os excellent camera low speaker output brilliant display and sunlight legibility  slow mo also works fine this has good  low light capabilities.
--------------------------------------------------------
gorilla glass  1
My handset just fell from my hand and display got broken I felt shocked how gorrila glass.
Ya I ve tampared glass over the display but no back cover n there are hardly any scratches on the rare.
Gorilla glass would ve been great.
weak glass protection and customer care service is very poor if somehow you get in trouble with you phone parts are difficult to be found in case of physical damage.
K3 note having solid glass with no other protection.
it seems comapny is not using dragontrail glass .
so seems to have a pretty hard glass.
M2 note having dragontail glass with IGZO technology whereas YU plus having Corning Gorilla Glass3 .
Due to Gorilla glass  no need to put screen guard.
--------------------------------------------------------
power saving mode  -1
Battery is better in balanced mode and not good in performance mode.
It has got Super power saving mode similar to Samsung  pops up when the battery goes to 20  and below  Can be customized anytime.
Look of the phone and camera is awesome with manual mode and effects.
Sound effects are good in headset only and comes with Dirac HD sound mode which is much better than normal.
and abt UI its 1st tym m use flyme so its little difficult to me or many option in this phone like in security a guest mode is very good for whom not close to u. and like a inbuilt antivirus and appslock.
after used this phone m shocked about a camera outdoor pics is too good other dis segament phone bt little disappionted in indoor shooting in camera manual setting is very good mode.
and super power saving mode is gud.
--------------------------------------------------------
day to day  -1
That aside a great day to day runner without any hiccups.
Touch is so so good as it has dragentail glass and very grate brightness and even in sunny day you see clearly on screen.
Best in its class and works very fine in day to day life and work  appearance and all beautiful with working specs keep updating the software no glitches compromise on sound and bit of camera but it covers if you know how to set it dual flash works beautiful in night used it over 7 months  satisfied customer.
This phone is great for day to day heavy use.

Some may say that m2 comes with lolipop and latest flyme os but guys i would like to inform here that at first day usage i got the notification that 5.
Battery life is very good  easily goes over a day with moderate to heavy use.
It lasts upto whole day even after heavy usage.
I took a risk by buying this phone  but it turned out to be great  It has a great performance  good battery life  lasts for a whole day  and I was very impressed by it s super power saver mode which can elongate the phone s battery  I turned it on at 18  and it lasted for 12 hours .
Have to admit that battery performance is truly phenomenal  It easily lasts the entire day with moderate to heavy usage on 4G N W with some juice still left.
Is too much  almost 15 day  are  gone from pickup date  but  I don t get my  refund  otherwise gud product.
Below are my observationsBack camera Could have been betterFront cam  very goodBattery GoodDisplay  good somewhat has a yellowish white not exactly whiteSpeed  good enough for day to day tasks not a gamer so can t judge that but there is not much lagSoftware or Flyme OS  Awesome it s the best I have used till date and can t wait for Flyme 5.
