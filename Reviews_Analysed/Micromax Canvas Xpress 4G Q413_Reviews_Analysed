customer care  1
Problem with the handset when i watching movies online and surfing and put my phone on charge battery still draing again i recommend guys do not buy any product from this site for worse customer care .

Bitter experience with Micromax and was compelled to return the product.
I had very bad experience with phone and its service centre.
Very bad experience had to return the handset bcoz of major problem always go for branded handset 
 It had become bad experience with this model piece.
