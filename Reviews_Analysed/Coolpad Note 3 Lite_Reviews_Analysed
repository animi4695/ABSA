Gaming   3 star  Played heavy games and observed little lags while playing  also observed mobile heats little bit  but managble.
Camera feels a little bit cheapest.
Mainly the FINGERPRINT SCANNER is superb and it unlocks the phone in a very little bit of time.
Phone is great by look and features but the only little disappointment is camera colours its little bit can be improved and it has a little bit heating issue but overall phone is great and must buy productI received this phone on February 2.
but camera is little bit let down.
Little bit bugs.
Little bit slow processer.
For  those who want to store more data it is a little bit uncomfort.
While charging it heats up little bit.
go for itTheir is a little heating problem in this phone and after 15 days itself  the back cam is giving blurred images so little bit disappointed with itIf u are searching for a budget smartphone then this one is a killer.

everything  12
very happy everything in this awesome 3gb RAM finger print sensor at this cost.
Except that everything is well and good.
Bought it to my friend facing issues now with some functional aspectsCamera quality is very chip please increase a quality other wise goodExcept charging everything is OK sometime it gets heat after long useThis mobile  camer is not equal to 2mp of lenovoa6000 just given 13mpThe phone I don t know but seal was broken and it s not charging alsoThis camera is very bad.
Everything else works fine.
everything is working fine since last 2 months .
But ignoring the battery  everything i mean everything is very efficieng  even the camera is acceptable.
Everything s good except the display.
Awesome phone for 7000. battery needs to be better but everything else is good.
Everything else seems fine.
Other than the above everything is working fine.
Is everything is OK but the display is very poor colors   contrast is not in balanced.
Except dat everything is goodUnable to connect to mobile data instantly  need to restart every time to connect to internetNice phone got on 25 feb. On this price this is the best phone in market .
Everything was good but the display is not goodNice product it s very nice thanks for amazon.
Apart from that everything is good.
So  everything is OK now with Coolpad Note 3 Lite for me.
Everything is working good except the below1.
Rest everything is nice.
Rest everything is just perfect and at this pricepoint its a total killer.
waiting for OTA updatesSimply awesome with more reliable featuresNice phone very fast I like this very muchExcept camera quality everything is fine.
everything is fine except battery.
Everything is fine.
What s really cool is that everything is available within a few taps and most of the time just two taps or drags are all you need.
Otherwise everything else is perfect.
Everything is okay  except few things like Yahoo account unable to setup through apps and facebook app is giving connection time out error while browsing and instead of having full network.
Rest everything is good.

in low light  -12
Main camera is worst  for photos particularly in low light.
Even my Sony Cybershot gets grainy without flash in low light.
Camera quality also good even low light.
I can t book I think this is fakeSleek  light and value for moneyI am unable to buy.
Most of all writing camera is average but in real it has good camera result compared to 10k phones but ya front camera is average in low light but super in day time.
Focus well and use flash in low light.
especially in good light the camera is really awsome for a 7k phone.
Use HDR mode in good light and dim light shot in low light.
camera not like 13megapixel and image becomes noisy at low light but at this price you won t get camera better than this.
although they were bright in low light .
camera has some noise in low light conditions  but using apps like camera360 and candycam helps you take decent pictures in low light conditions also.
it is too good  works good in low light as well  you just need to click pictures using right modes.
Fp sensor works great   Camera is too good in light.
Photos taken in low light are bad.
if you can increase your budget go for coolpad note 3 i have bought both of themdoes not confuse with redmi 2 prime low light pics are better than it.
CAMERA 7 10 good in outdoor and average in poor in low light and average in artificial light.
It struggles in low light to autofocus and gives grainy and washed out colors.
Camera is good but not excellent in low light may be updates will fix it.

option  10
I think to go with other brand is good option.
Camera very average and when I click any photo its backside too much heating and no other option in camera setting.
AnTuTu benchmark   32290Non removable 2500mAh battery  quick charge option is available under battery settings.
Front superb selfiesThe mobile was really superb If fast charging option is presnt i wil give u 5 stars I think so i got a defective piece it has some small bugs like mobile data was not getting on until restart the mobile battery was excellent by using wifi or games but using mobile data it was draing in 4 hours.
Almost all the apps you can move to SD card  which is a very good option in this phone.
There no  only 3G  or  only 4G  selection option under cellular network option due to this  this mobile runs on 2G network most of time.
very bad  now  a  days 32 gb is not enough to useBuggy function and hanging problem better option available in market under 7000 Rupees.
And it was dont have the option black list .
2016. camera good in outdoor finger print option fantastic useful.
For budget buyers this is the best option that you can get.
Its a third class cell plz who all look over dis cell dnt even take it plz go for next  option bcz its mike is too bad quality.

Fast and accurate fingerprint scanner.
The best is fingerprint scanner its just the best.

great camera features and fingerprint scanner also working good.
Mainly the FINGERPRINT SCANNER is superb and it unlocks the phone in a very little bit of time.

True value for money.
Very nice and value for money.
this is an awesome product nice headphone  brilliant camera one of the best front camera and the fingerprint sensor is 2 quick  lovely features absolute value for moneyI received on 2 feb.
Opinion   looking at its cost and features its quite obvious that for costcutting the multimedia features were supressed  so overall its a value for money smartphone and looking at its performance its good to buy if u have a budget of 7k.
Value worth productIt gives very low sound on FM  as compare to other mobilesExcellent  better performance this price but heating issueWorth on price.
Any way one of the best Value for money product from Coolpad.

This phone is really good value for money.
Definitely the CN3L is very good value for money spent  and it was delivered earlier than expected.

Screen is HD and gives acceptable viewing angle experience.
Very bad experience.
I have got one three days back   having an awesome experience.
worst experience with its wi.
I cant expect much better phone than this in present scenario  my experience is really awesome.
Screen visblity kafi achhi h. Video dkhne me aur game khelne me aapko achha visual experience dega.
Needless to thank Amazon for best experience of shopping and shipping.
so that I returned itvery bad experience within 201 days my mobile getting hanged and not screen touch was not working as usual CHina PhoneThe battery back up is not continue at least 5 hours.
It s a very good phone but sometime while playing multiplayer with others or ours Bluetooth or wifi hotspot it hangs some times and gives bad experience please fix it if any one knows the solutionGood phone .
Heating at the top end  especially near ear end speakers goes upto 117 F  make the worst experience of calling and browsing while heavy usaged.
Awesome never ever seen at this priceI am useing this phone wef mar 20 yr 16 and having bed experience due to over heating problem even after normal useI have faced some problems in this mobile suddenly drain battery over heating around the camera and hanging problemProduct is good in price and usage but the phone is getting heat while charging and browsing net.
And the looks are also cool  yes it lacks some features which we indians were used to  but new features added by Cool Ui are also Awesome Overall an Amazing Experience Received 3rd Feb after 5 pm with amazing amazon transportation service  I dont understand if screen have Scratch resistance so why screen protector strip in the box   Battery backup not good may be it draing too fast  82  to 47  in 1  half an hour  when download apps via wi.
I didn t like preloaded cool ui so I downloaded Google now launcher it gives good experience.
Not fast as expected  vr not supported as no gyroscopeThe deal is ok  but no servive centre near Navi MumbaiNice  looking mobile and best price with this featuresPhone typing is very slow and phone is getting hangedVery good experience.
So far it has been a good experience with the phone.
this phone back camera according they told us 13 MP but its working like 3 MP Camera All over bad experience.

Good experience from this product.
it has a good oping sound while the 3gb ram gave a new experience if speed .

sd card  -2
It plays daily different types of tones  songs from the memory card with super back ground.
So you have to buy external SD card.
sd card slote also not working when insert sd card so kindly look into matter as asap and refund the amount in my account My friends there are many reviews showing several problems.
The worst part is its camera  though its claim to be 13MP and 5MP respectively  when you actually click the photo  you will have hard time recognizing the person  If you know about the adhaar card  voter id photo  you will understand what I am talking about.
The second sim card is not readable and the phone is hence not good.
unable to read the card.
All my Videos and other files in SD card are intact and I am enjoying the Phone greatly.

usage  -2
Battery runs one day easily with moderate usage.
battery lasts a day with normal to high usage.
Battery performance is also OK. Last a day on moderate usage.
Lot of features and helped to blind peoples and usage is very much happy only disadvantage is battery life is one day only remaing r very exciting and Thank Amazon   coolpadAll features are good  but cannot be match expectations in matter with camera.
Device heats up only with intensive usage   games etc  Very good for daily usage I also own a nexus 4 and it feels quite better in terms of offering   except for the build quality both Cameras are very good for the price range     in fact better than yureka  Finger print scanner works 99 of 100 times so no complain there .
3GB RAM and fast processor ensures that the phone never lags and the performance never comes down even when running 20 apps in background P. S. I checked the other critical reviews about this product where people are returning the phone because they don t understand how to use the camera app  I assure this is the best camera quality one can get in its class  Though i wish it had at least 4000MaH battery but even with the current battery capacity  it survives almost 2 days of wild usage I found this product awesome.
but internet usage was too good.
It lasts for a day on moderate usage.
I am using for last six days  with heavy usage of internet  but not have any heating problem.
Both sim support 4G   not available to my state as on 2500mAh  battery is OK for a regular usage.
Battery last for a day upto to 15  with moderate usage   40min on call   30 min FullHD video playback   1.
If u need privacy   jst Go for it guyzzthe only red marks are that the battery gets discharged pretty fast while gaming  the phone takes a while to charge and the phone get heated up too soon on medium to heavy usage.
Heavy usage honey par bhi phone hang nhi krega.
but back gets heated on long usage.
--------------------------------------------------------
charger  -2
Not able to charge the phone with original charger.
Also  the charger is not 2A and 1A is fairly okay.
package contains only mobile  charger manual ear phone was missing.
Battery charging taking more time nearly 3hrs  From 0  to 100  with original 1Amp charger and quick charge mode.
Camera is also very good2500 mah battery is enough for a day or twoMarvelous fingerprint sensor gives it a different place among other smartphoneBut still low points areHuge charging time   heating problemFor reducing charging time you can use other charger of a little high powerThis phone is very bad.
6 hour and when the mobile in working condition just like gaming and youtube then the mobile not charge in this time mobile also discharge not mobile charge after the some time the mobile is switch off although the mobile phone plug in charger so i am  very confuse because i want to colpad note 3Very bad batteryOn charging after low batteryWorest battery life ever  But phone is amazing.
Original charger takes a lot of time to charge the mobile and so it is recommended to use a high power charger.
--------------------------------------------------------
amazon  -2
i would never suggest for amazon in future for anyone.
And Amazon is not ready to refund the product.
BUT WORST CAMERA 13MPOVER ALL OKAYPlease don t buy this mobile and don t waste your time and valuable money better go for any other mobile don t buy in Amazon too one u read amazon policy if u agree with Amz T C u can proceed.
Good camera  excellent performance  long battery life  multitasking is smartThanku amazon for fast deliveryIst of all i would like to thank amazon for its timely delivery.
Amazon is awesome with the return policy.
Thanks to Amazon for such awesome product.
I am totally satisfied  and the Amazon service is on time and Good.
Delivery from amazon was also nice.
And the looks are also cool  yes it lacks some features which we indians were used to  but new features added by Cool Ui are also Awesome Overall an Amazing Experience Received 3rd Feb after 5 pm with amazing amazon transportation service  I dont understand if screen have Scratch resistance so why screen protector strip in the box   Battery backup not good may be it draing too fast  82  to 47  in 1  half an hour  when download apps via wi.
Later on I found this as my best amazon product ever.
Good performance  can sync everything well  and 4G compatibility is so good But AMAZON  dont give your packages to be delivered to GATI COURIER.
I knew that Amazon is best but I will agree if I satisfied with new original product.
Good product and Amazon serviceExcellent product in this pricei liked this product .
It was good that amazon gave me replacement  for the first order this phone had heating issue well you couldn t belive even the second phone has is heating issue while playing game for ten minutes and even watching videos.

playing games  -2
Battery gets drained up faster when we are playing high graphic games.
Heating issues only while playing heavy games  you can play moderate or low end games without any issues.
very low heating problem even while playing heavy games.
It looks good and never hang or heat even though on playing heavy games for an one hour.
And when playing heavy games apps  its heating.
And while playing heavy Games.
--------------------------------------------------------
high end games  2
But you cant expect it to play Asphalt 8 Nova 3 modern combat 5 like heavy games with high graphics setting.
Battery gets drained up faster when we are playing high graphic games.
Awesome mobile in this price I like this mobile very much and the touch works like iPhoneVery bad item charger is not workingA handset with a real crisp screen  Coool features  great battery  good camera  less heating even while playing high end games and the most important thing got a lot of ram with a really cool UI that too with regular updates and that too in an affordable price.
All the features of the phone is unbeatable and I can play multiple games in a single screen without lag and its best phone for gaming but when you play high graphic games the phone gets little hot and battery will drain when I play online game apart from that camera is good fingerprint is working as I expect .
Heating issues only while playing heavy games  you can play moderate or low end games without any issues.
Now coming to the gaming experince is phenominal because mali t720 alows you to play high end games like asphalt 8 nova 3 nfs most wanted wwe immortals and many games storage is really good i got 10 gb which is good charging time really sucks i takes around 5 hours to charge if you are working on phone but it takes around 4 hours when you are not working on it everything is awesome in this phone but little disappointed with charging time but  dude its 7000rs and its all worth.
very low heating problem even while playing heavy games.
Phone heating problem and it doesn t get charge ING while we use higher end applicationgreat performance.
even when running high end gamesover heat and charge will be taken  five hoursnice mobile in this price and timely deliveredfantastic device.
And while playing heavy Games.
Phones performance is OKAY  It will last for a day if u r  using WhatsApp  calls and some small games.
My usage isn t for heavy games   stuff.
Games will be sluggish and sometime other apps too.
High end games work smooth.
N the mobile get lite heat when u do anything like  playing games or multitaskingBe cool wit cool pad.
overall its awesome deal in 7000rsmy advice if you are a casual mobile phone youser go for it or if your main purpose is to play games thats too good to buy.
Here is my reviewWho should buy this1  Stringent Budget2  Single handed use  5 inch 3  Who do not prefer to play high end games  Mid   lower end games runs smoother 4  Who uses bunch of apps simultaneously  News  social  E. purchase  mails   office  small games  movies   Music  trust me  you never get shortage of RAM and performance.
High end Specifications  Finger print scanner   3GB RAM .
Even I played high end games but no lag that i found.
Multitasking  with 3 gb RAM  you can play heavy games without any lag.
Finger print sensor with very high end feature.
Can anybody tried it and found any solution  I am waiting to resolve this issue  good phone for the beginners but not for those who have high end usage b coz when phone gets heatup it starts hanging and some apps doesn t work.
Phone has never hanged since last 10days of use even with heavy games.
Device heats up only with intensive usage   games etc  Very good for daily usage I also own a nexus 4 and it feels quite better in terms of offering   except for the build quality both Cameras are very good for the price range     in fact better than yureka  Finger print scanner works 99 of 100 times so no complain there .
Didn t tried Top end games but play store s high rated games runs without lag.
Gaming 7 10 Low and medium graphics game can be played easily and high end games can played at medium graphics setting.
It does not heat up easily and playing high end games like Asphlat 8 nova 3 etc for about an hour it is heating slightly but not more heat.
And when playing heavy games apps  its heating.
Battery is a bit insufficient and runs out in less than a day if you a heavy user It also heats up if you play high end games.
Camera is wonderful   can support high end gameCharging time is very large up to 3.
Good speed  camera is not good as expected good battery life  and some games are not compatable.
It looks good and never hang or heat even though on playing heavy games for an one hour.

Battery   good take 2 to 3 hours to full charge no heating problemsCamera   average Overall performance.
it is taking too much time around 4 to 5 hours  to get full charge  Battery backup is not good.
