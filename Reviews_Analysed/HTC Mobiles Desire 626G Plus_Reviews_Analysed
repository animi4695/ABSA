bad camera  -25
2  The back camera is also too good.
poor quality camera
The picture quality of both primary and secondary camera is good.
my second issue was with camera as u all can also check that this phone has 13MP rear camera but the picture quality of this camera is not equal to 5MP phone and when i zoom the captured image it becomes hazy.
Phone is really super look i am happy it has 5MP front camera.
camera quality is very poor.
phone is very good  screen is very smooth  camera quality is very good but not good to front 5mp quality so overall phone is very good 
even in the good light pic taken from rear camera gives very low quality and thus ultimately i decided to take refund.
camera quality very poor.
The back 13 mp camera does its job while the 5 mp front camera is only good if you or the phone are still and there is enough light.

review  -2
I can go on and on but here is the short review.
It is with sheer disappointment and unpleasantness that I am forced to write a bad review about this phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  -2
It takes too much time to open basic apps.
44GB then you can t install morethan 5 apps.
--------------------------------------------------------
android  2
 Doesn t come with 64bit Architecture   so no hopes for future Android Firmware Upgrades
UI is of a typical android phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
nano sim  -2
but nano sim is not understood.
But the problem is  this phone simtype is nano sim.
--------------------------------------------------------
worst mobile  -2
returned the product but again get the defetive product from flipkart and it takes 20 days to return .
And i dont know if this will get lollipop or not but the device is good for its price and performance.
--------------------------------------------------------
internal storage  2
 The main problem with this device it has limited internal storage .
2 and the internal storage was given 8GB but it shows only 5.
--------------------------------------------------------
internal memory  2
Low memory  8 GB 
Only 8gb internal memory  but thank god it s expandable.
Now internal memory.
The only issue is the low internal memory   8 Gb  and hence one needs to cough up a few more bucks for a memory card.
2GB if you installed some more app as per your requirement then internal memory remain in your phone only 1.
--------------------------------------------------------
processor  2
processor is good
5 month   ths phone awesome by looking   good camera   greate processor   totally excellent .
core processor is really fast.
very good processor.
--------------------------------------------------------
htc desire  2
 the mobile HTC Desire 626G Plus which i have ordered from flip cart that was a come with damage back cover and screen had bobble this is the second time i have order electronic item from it
I m so glad to buy HTC Desire 626G on flipkart.
--------------------------------------------------------
sar rating  1
high sar rating
I preffered this phone over moto G2 just because i thought HTC might be having lower SAR rating.
After recieving the phone I saw that this phone also have a high SAR rating.
--------------------------------------------------------
order  -1
The price of product when i ordered the phone was 15 300 and now it s 16 200. and the new order delivery will take more time to get delivered.
--------------------------------------------------------
htc sense  -1
One more bad thing about this phone is its htc sense version 5 
--------------------------------------------------------
1 gb ram  -1
RAM is 1 GB which is not sufficient.
1 GB Ram is too low for this configuration 
In this price i think i am get 2 gb ram if i choose other brand
Ram is jst 1gb 
phone is good with 1 gb ram touch is very nice.
4  RAM only   GB  internal memory only 8GB in price Rs.
Cons   only simple TFT display 2000 mah  1 GB ram is too less No gorilla glass only 8 GB internal storage.
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
games  -1
but now whats is surprising is i am a mobile gamer and inspite of playing my games this mobile lasts 21 hours easily.
Recently i was purchased HTC DESIRE  its getting hangout at the time of youtube and playing games  i am very disappointed about this phone  Iphone is better than this Desire phone 
i tried to run few heavy games and most of the apps altogether on this phone and it didn t lag at all that was a common mans way of bench marking .
