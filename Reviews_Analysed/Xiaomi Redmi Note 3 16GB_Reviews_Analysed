set design and performace is very nice with the rear camera quality great battery backup.
I had missed so many moments of my college life due to lack of good camera phone.
Otherwise rear camera is also good.
It is the bestI don t know why product demands quality of rear camera is 16 Mp but i hundred percent sure that it has rear camera similar to 8 mega pixel instead of 16 mega pixel.
The Biggest Pro of the device is The  BATTERY incoming call not connected when you are using internetcamera quality is average  but battery back up is nice.
I would be happy enough if they improve the camera quality and add the quick charge facility in there next update.
I like big screen and cool camera features   both are available in this phone and i like most in this is its design   sooo nice My First review on Redmiused it for a day only  looks are stunning  it will definitely beat any expensive phone  Sound quality Good  picture quality good  camera performance is good in day light  low light performance is average  but still it can be used  battery back up is good i have used it as a daily user only for surfing  phone calls  whatsapp  some pictures clicking  full day connected to wifi  battery drained 25   from morning 10 am to 8pm after full charge.

good one  but need to remove MI app  it comes with virusHow is sound in headphone and speaker can anyone suggestIt s a another great product from mi  of course it looks great battery is great  beautiful design but camera segment is very disappointed   xiomi should consider camera for a mid range handset is crucial part.
I think xiaomi should provide some solution as well as Amazon it s heating up even at normal useThis is a very nice smart phone with long battery life.

sound speaker sounds above average   they are loud and clear  headphone output is really nice  i will recoomend you to use mi sound enhancer plus change setting in audio section if you are using high end headphoneswifi   network  wifi   dual sim works fine so far and have no issuesOVERALL CONCLUSION  THE 32 GB VARIANT SEEMS OUT OF STOCK  AND WILL TAKE TIME TO GET BACK IN STOCK  BUT STILL IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THE 16 GB VARIANT   GO WITH IT BLINDLY   IT WORTH THE PRICE  ITS STILL BETTER THAN K4 NOTE AND LETV LE 1S IN MOST OF ASPECTSIF I WILL FIND ANY OTHER PROBLEMS IN FUTURE   I WILL SURELY WRITE ABOUT ITThe mobile is good very good battery backupbut received no accessories with it  for 10k rupees    Microphone stops working randomly.
Battery this is undoubtedly the USP of this set as it gives surprisingly long battery life.
Very disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good at allDamage product on 28 3 but still not refund or replacement provide think twice before buyThis phone is gud one  dual sim  but the use of two sim or one sim plus memmory card is a draw back.
Battery  4000 is really good one but why Redmi is keeping silence and not changing to type C with heavy charger like your competitor Le Eco Tv .
only battery is good otherwise all bad .

bad performance  -36
The performance is awesome and the place where I was concerned was 2gb ram of it but it turned out it s not a prblm at all the phone works flawlessly and the battery is the biggest pros of this phone after charging it fully I got 3 30hrs or SOT WITH HEAVY USAGE  and 76  battery left.
Im using 16gb vadiant  performance  is very good.
U can buy this but there r other phone like coolpad note 3 with offers much more feature and good performance than xiaomi note 3.
1  The performance is very fluid and completely lag free.
Bad camera performance not able to click just 3mp .
It has not slowed down under multiple applications usage  so I m OK with its performance.
and low light performance is worst like 2mp camera.
1 Camera Performance is subpar.
Its been 10 days I am using this Note3  redmi and its performance has been impressive.
All said and done I feel the Redmi Note 3 is a fantastic buy for the price and feels premium and offers smooth satisfying performance.
the redmi note 3 works well and performance is awesome.
What s app and other app is not working due to bug but overall experience is goodBattery backup disappoints meAnd wifi is not working properly heating issueIts just classy best cam best screen best performance just go for it its too goodpurchased on 6 April.
Performance is goodSuper mobile with good quality cameraOne word for budget phone .
Jitna expectation tha xiaomi se   iska performance utna bhi acha nhi he guys.
And yes a smooth lag free performance.
Overall  very poor performance  requesting yo do R D fir removing these issue than replaced my set with new one.
I checkout it s benchmark and the performance it s quite good if you are looking for a good budget  bundle of features  phone xiomi redmi note 3 is also be the good choice don t worry about the 2 GB RAM  over all performance is good.
Working great but rear camera a performance is not so good.
Temperature reaches 45 while charging  playing low games like coc keeps temperature around 40Delivery was late but overall packing was good  no lag whatsoeverPlayed high end games like nova3 and asphalt 8 good performance 0 lag with maximum graphicsPros  built qualityVivid displaySound quality is decentBattery is excellent with around 1day backup with heavy usageSuper processorCons  heating like frying panCamera not upto mark but focus is goodIf i missed anything pardon mePreviously in a 1st look I really liked this product.
The redmi note 3 works well and performance is awesome.
I feel that my REDMI 1S guves a better performance than REDMI NOTE 3EswarCamera is just average.

How stupid is that I will keep it updated as I come with other issues.
Good phone i am using it for last seven days there is no problem at all phone running very well no lag no heating problem while heavy gaming but i think that 3GB model will be better choice because if you install lots of apps or games than more than 90  ram will use that may cause phone lagging or other problem.

Seriously  i am constantly getting 8 hrs of screen on time and since it s a new device you can imagine how much time i must be spending on it  Great battery will easily last a working day So that covers it all i guess  There are a few other issues  like the google keyboard  which again is not optimized but trust me when i tell you  nothing wrong with this device which can t be fixed with a software update   Go for it Cheers Lastly i regestered for 3 gb Ram n 32 gb Rom .
So dear if you face heating issue with this phone please update system and enjoy.

This Phone Worths The Every Penny You Spend On iti got the 16 gb variant   i was not able to get 32gbThough 16gb is not a problem  but 2g ram is a little bit problem  as the phone has only about 800 mb ram free to use  still it is sufficient if you are not a very heavy useradvantages  its huge monsterous 4050mah battery which can easily last for a full day after heavy usageits display which produces very crispy and sharp colours  video  photo and all other things looks good on phone   viewing angles are good toofinger print sensor works amazingly  its very responsivemi ui is one of the best ui  you have so many customizations in your phone which makes the phone really coolits dual sim  so you can have two sims in the phonedisadvantages  2 gb ram is not enough if you are a heavy user   phone can lag a bit  but if you are a normal user then ram is not a problem at allabout camera  camera clicks decent pics  both back and front cam takes decent pics in good light  its above averageheating issues  i have not find any heating issues so far  i played several games  but the phone did not get hot very much .
this flash sale gives really bad message about amazonSuperb Mobile Not even found any single problem or default I read many reviews about heating problems but I din face this problem.
No heating issue  excellent battery backup and camera results.
tacky to operate in starting but iys good except the heating issues.
One issue is that the phone heats up quite a lot while charging but otherwise no prominent heating issues.

Great phone with great looks.
01This phone looks very good and from the day  I bought the phone everyone has been asking about it.

HummmgreatWastegreatMy mobile sensor not workingNice phone with great looks.
It has reasonably good looks.
and now it is perfectly fine without compromising on the premium looks.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 3  Gold  16GB After 3 days of usePros 1. looks are awsum2.
The phone ki very good in condition awesome mobile looks like iPhone 6s plus mobileSir hum isko kaise purchase kare buy now add to cart ka option hi nahi aa rha ismeOne major drawback is that we can use second sim or memory card any one at a timeNice phone in this price range ho gold colour is much better than grey   silver.
--------------------------------------------------------
with memory card  14
32gb internal memory without expendable memory may be a biggest issue in feature.
Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
Phone Memory   In case of 16gb version internal unused space is 9gb  so much memory allocated for some pre installed app and Lollipop update.
Available memory.
Product is good  if it is having seperate  slot for memory card  removable battery option  sim insert slot is  still best phonei received faulty unit  with no volumes coming from speaker  so i had to return and im awaiting for the refund since last monthGuys  this seller sends item without quality check.
And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
When is 32 GB variant if note 3 launchingNiceBut memory slot is big problemgoodGoodawsmgoodlikeNiceUltimate Performance.
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
So loosing memory storageDecided to go with Le 2 .
It s an awesome phone and hv a premium  look camera is OK battery is good  only problem is memory and sim  slot Dere is only two slots either  u can put memory card or sim.
But a sdcard if possible it will help the cell a lot for extra memory .
I didnot check sim2 and used memory card in second slot which also worked fine.
5 GB internal memory available for user consumption.
33 GB for a 16GB phone after company installed apps  when using dual sim  we cant use memory card.
It has not clearly mentioned in the phone description that TWO SIM CARDS AND A MEMORY CHIP Card will not work together  which is true.
no bugs n no lags with no low memory prob .
Thus if two SIM are being used then expendable memory option is ruled out.
LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
The redmi note 3  32gb  is best because is there internal memory is 32gb.
Also internal memory available is shown 8 gb only.
Good mobile but cam Avg  excellent display  superb  looking good profomance  gud battery backupExelent productThe put the temperdglass on my phone   the phone was getting hang   now i replace the phone but the amazon dont give my money for temperdglassGood phone in this range all features are working properlyNot available in internal memory 16GB in Xiaomi  MI note 3I purchase for my friend .
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
Its very good productBut its by prose s is very tuffThis is fraud mobile because its internl memory 11 gb onlyNot worth the wait.
however company could have given the option of expandable memory.
Extendable memory won t allow to use two sim cards.
Good Mobile phone in budget range  But internal memory is less for use Product was delivered on time and have no complaints about the phone.
Its describe that it is dual sim with expendable memory.
Hybird Slot   If you are using two sim and required memory for you is more then 10 gb than that is a problem for you.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
Can t use memory card along with duel sim.
Available memory is 11 gb not 16 gb  and user available is around 9.
its tooo good dudeCan we use dual sim   memory card same timeVery disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good5 STARS for the product and 5 STARS for Amazon delivery service.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
grey n silver are betterMobile having 1slot for both external memory and nano sim.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
As alwys Xiaomi rocks but can be little cheaper as other phone offer same applications  coolpad but charger makes noise   i dont know what to do  pros1 design2 battery3 uicons1  only 2 ports  sim sim or sim   32gb sd card 2  heating while charging3  heating while playing games4  no accessories5  above avg camera6 only 9 gb is free7 ram 800 mb is freeFast delivery  the product is awesome  worth 10K but the only problem is the RAM  I guess MI must start selling 32 GB phones   because this phone  s internal memory occupies 50  of the RAm.
They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.
i thought have good and enough memory but i can t increase memory with dual simIt s a little big for normal hands  also getting metallic finish  gets a bit slippery.
Can t ask for more at this price  Purchased 3 phones in total for my family camera quialty not goodinternal memory not good for user so low total 11.
Negative points are  inbuilt memory is inadequate.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Also 16GB internal memory is filled with some preloaded apps  so you cant expect lot of free space  it was 9.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .
Because of not supporting dual sim along with external memory.
not working with dual sim and no memory expandable.
Phone is okey You will get only 9 gb usable internal memory for all your apps   movies   songs.
Good But its Taking too Much Memory taking 5 GB internally to run  I think its too much  Better to Go for 32 GB versionI think mi note 3 mobile is very good mobile under 10000camera.
The only drawback is that only 10GB out of 16GB of internal memory is available for use.
Xiaomi had said that this phone has expandable memory but there is no such thing in this phone.
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
The internal memory is said to be 16gb but it is 11gb after the pre installed apps .
And sim card memory card changing or replacing system is quite difficult.

bad display  -12
BUILD QUALITY Probably the best  if not the best  The phone feels premium in the hand and certainly looks costlier than it actually is  especially the golden variant i think DISPLAY I was a little unhappy with the display at first but then i realized there was a protective layer on the SCR n which i had nt taken off  Once i did that  I was pleasantly surprised  great saturation of colours  great colour accuracy.
Heating is Very HighIts a budget phone and compact phone  camera is not good though despite being a 16mp one  sounds are good  display is best and it has sunlight readability  not much lagThis is a very bad phone .
overall a good productspeaker problemGreat features for small price but Display is not good.
It is a 1080p display and it produces crystal clear picture quality and also the phone looks very expensive and feels totally premium due to the metallic body on the back .
Nice product  awesome performanceBrighness is very low in display.
Amazing phone  looks great  extra ordinary battery life  crisp and sharp display  average camera.
OTG support3 Audio quality  both Loudspeaker and Earphones  is great4 Display is sharp and bright5 Good In.
i am getting the same display as attached from past 2 hours.
No lag what so everPhone is good  camra good but tha display light  against samsung.
Heating problem and 1sim   memory cardNice phone camera quality is not greatPar beyond experience with this gadgetNice Cellphone  Battery Amazing  i loved this phone  thanks amazon   MIgood for normal use but not for cameraExcellent  mobile  I really  like thisBattery and camera are equal to Redmi2SUPERP XIAOMI REDMI NOTE 3 GOLD 16 GB Average phone only battery lyf is goodAt 9999  what else can you demand   it has everything of a nice phone   camera is good enough but don t keep too high expectations  sound output is good   display and and over all performance is very decent   a little too big in size but again you get a massive battery life out of 4000mhz inside  fingerprint scanner works fine   I would say it does what it saysIm using  this phone since a week.

in low light  -11
Very nice light weight nice clearity superb featuresFirst of al  when i saw d spec n price n design of d phone very impressed n ordered it throught gotdam flash sale.
only drawback is camera quality at low light.
in low light images n video look like VGA camera don t get cheated if u are a photo freak.
I see lot of people giving 1 star for the camera on low light photos  even if you buy a phone just for photos it definitely deserves better.
Camera doesn t work that much in low light.
Good for low light.
In low light images lil bit blurred.
2. there is no bad quality camera  i hav seen cameras of many smartphons that fails under low light  but 10000 me is se better kya loge  awsm3.
Also  low light camera quality is not good even with Flash.
Camera is average and slightly bad in low light.
In low light it s very noisy and in good light conditions even though the pictures look good it doesn t have enough details when you zoom in.
All good apart from Camera performance in low light and VoLTEBefore buying check the quality of product and service or xiaomiHere is my experience .
Flash light is very bad.
My K3 note gives better clarity in low light as compared to Redmi but considering price I think it s OK.
The only problems are bad low light camera  below average selfie camera   no gorilla glass protection.
While the pictures taken in outdoor light is passable  the camera struggles in indoor lighting and fails terribly in low light conditions.
LOW Light in display   should be more brighterProbably the best phone in this price.
Apart from that camera of the phone is really good   The front camera of the phone gives excellent picture quality but the rear camera of 16mp is not that impressive in low light but produces good quality pics in day light .
Very poor performance in low light conditionsMIUI is using a lot of RAM and only 800MB leftHybrid SIM slot is not appreciablePhone is heating up  while charging and also while playing heavy gamesWe don t know about which type of protection is used for screenOver all good mobile apart from camera qualityI switched from iphone5 to this phone.
Low light photos are not so great  but this happens on nikon canon high end cameras as well .
Camera is really good in well lighted area  not bad in low light.
This Phone Worths The Every Penny You Spend On iti got the 16 gb variant   i was not able to get 32gbThough 16gb is not a problem  but 2g ram is a little bit problem  as the phone has only about 800 mb ram free to use  still it is sufficient if you are not a very heavy useradvantages  its huge monsterous 4050mah battery which can easily last for a full day after heavy usageits display which produces very crispy and sharp colours  video  photo and all other things looks good on phone   viewing angles are good toofinger print sensor works amazingly  its very responsivemi ui is one of the best ui  you have so many customizations in your phone which makes the phone really coolits dual sim  so you can have two sims in the phonedisadvantages  2 gb ram is not enough if you are a heavy user   phone can lag a bit  but if you are a normal user then ram is not a problem at allabout camera  camera clicks decent pics  both back and front cam takes decent pics in good light  its above averageheating issues  i have not find any heating issues so far  i played several games  but the phone did not get hot very much .
I hv given 1star  Less because camera performance in low light is not up to the mark.
go for itCamera in low light is not so good which is only con and we can not expect more from phone under 10K.
its pics are not that good in low light .
Instead of more mega pixcels camera  should have improved the quality of the picture in low light.
It is more than good in day light  when it comes to low light photography even the 30k or 40k worth smartphone cameras delivers an average class of photo.
Low light .
Problem with low light.
Low light photos r not so good.
Camera is poor in moderate and low light.
Camera struggle in low light when we capture  an image and zoom that particular picture and during video recording too.
--------------------------------------------------------
usage  -10
Even after lots of search and troubleshooting  i am not able to configure the Finger touch sensorBest mobile for gaming and camera is quite good for the price point battery around 2 days from normal usage high usage 1 day awesome build qualityPhone is good in its appearance otherwise it has worst camera quality in MI phone ever have  occasionally hang  over heat  fingerprint sensor failed.
Bought this phone for my mom and as of now no complaints as such but then her usage is also not that high.
Here are my observations after one week of heavy usage.
At the time of heavy usage phone become extremely hot and i turn off it.
Heats up at little usage.
Overall  its an ideal device for daily usage as well as high performance tasks.
Only positive in day to day usage is the battery that will last a day under super heavy usage.
5 days on heavy usage .
2days battery life  with moderate usage  at the cost of 2 hrs of charging.
Battery life is okay  considering my average usage it last for one day.
secondly wen i got d phone within 24 hours of usage i hav issues like device heating  network off on automaticlly  screen rotation problem n dat sim slot not opening properly.
Now no major heating issue apart from regular minor heat with continuous usage.
AnTuTu and GeekBench scores after almost 2 months of usage is pretty good.
But after getting charged you cant feel any heating problem even with a very heavy usage.
One sim usage is fine and everything works perfect.
Will last for 1 1 2 to 2 days easily with heavy usage.
camera is good  sound is nice and no heating issues observed while heavy usage.
10 hrs depending upon usage .
Battery is mind blowing   battery lasts for almost 2 days with high usage  .
Cons  No front facing flash in the front cameraI got my redmi note 3 device on 7th May due to issue of not able to sign in to my Google Account I replaced it the same problem continued in it the battery heats a lot during charging but overall continuous usage is best device till usedRefunding this one due too the same problem continuedCan t beat quality   features at this priceThough I ve requested replacement let s seeWell  It has surpassed my expectations.
The highlight is the fingerprint scanner and the battery   The battery lasts easily 2 days for moderate usage.
great battery performance last upto 30hrs with moderate usase but heavy continue usage it lasts upto7.
With a minimal usage for less than 1 hour per day  mainly for calls and whatapp messaging  the battery lasts for around 1 week.
--------------------------------------------------------
note 3 a  -10
Worst marketing techniqueredmi note 3  is excellent .
I feel that my REDMI 1S guves a better performance than REDMI NOTE 3EswarCamera is just average.
in serviceIt is hanging in between and switching offI love mi note 3 but i want 32 gb pls sellOsm mob vit such a low price.
I was used to being able to reach the entire screen with one hand which is not possible with the Note 3 and you have to jiggle the phone in your hand or use 2 hands.
Redmi note 3 gold 2GB RAM 16GB storage  this hand set is thinner  lighter and slightly shorter in length compared to Redmi Note 4G available with me.
Some time phone was slow showing wait for a second Overall note 3 is good.
Dont buy this phoneIt is working fine and really impressed by Amazon service and but video recording clarity is not good battery is great and finger print sensor is goodRedmi note 3 is fantastic mobile this mobile battery backup is amazingCamera is not that much good.
My new Redmi note 3 was not able to turn on wifi after 15.
4  The MIUI on the Redmi Note 3 is bloatware free and receives regular updates while the ROMs on the other devices is bloated and updates are not frequent.
32 gb wale ko apne g m bhr le mc bcHeats up too muchAverage phone in 10k priceDon t expect everything is good in this phoneIt s a cool gadget of redmi note 3 but  16gb  is not i think good is there 16gb internal and sim is nano is risky for insert sim in cell so i think 32gb cellphone is good.
4hours before sell   keep refreshing it and u will get any model good luck and I am waiting for my rn3this is average phone due to camera quality but all over goodand i think Meizu m3 note is better than thisWe have decided to stop shopping with Amazon because of the Redmi Note 3 sale.
Though I did not really expect Note 3 to do better  but thought it would be equal which it is not.
The phone was amazing but its front camera I don t understand y is blurrr and IMO is not connecting camera any one nows so plzz tell me ane U can use both sim but no memory and alot one is damage my simXiaomi note 3 is so sleek looking.
Yes its true some of redmi note 3 phone get heated but luckily not mine.
3  A larger 4050 mAh battery is present on the Redmi Note 3 while the K4 Note and Le 1s has battery capacity of around 3000 mAh.
Horrible handset  even after changing  problem exists  any1 from amazon can help me sort dis issueGreat amazing feeling to see my favorite redmi note 3 .
I m really glad that I waited to buy this instead of coolpad note 3 and Asus max .

sim or memory  8
one sim is nano sim  one sim is small sim  you may have to sacrifice one sim if you want to use a memory card for expansion.
Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
this phone not a dual sim is a singal sim because same time memory card   sim 2 both eligible are not use in same   battery is not removable   other earphone is not working this deviceNice phone with great features and specifications.
only one problem in the phone there is two sim slots but second sim slot is not working   if u use the memory card then it access   this phone is usually used for one sim.
An issue with inserting dual sim and memory card and the phone heated up with a longer use.
And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
Disadvantage is we cant use  2 Sim with Memory card on sametimeExecellent work done by u.
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
I didnot check sim2 and used memory card in second slot which also worked fine.
33 GB for a 16GB phone after company installed apps  when using dual sim  we cant use memory card.
if i use second sim will remove memory card from the device.
Thus if two SIM are being used then expendable memory option is ruled out.
we cannot insert both dual sim and a memory card in same time.
so that one can use dual sim as well as memory cardPreviously we had redmi 2 it was working well.
if you want use the memory card  SD card you need to use single sim only.
Everyone should buy itCamera Quality is not up to the mark  two SIM or single SIM with memory card option is available  too much heat at chargingRest is best in class specially dinner print sensor  processor etc so Awesome mobile phone at this range.
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
camera quality average  Network issue for BSNL sim card  contact save option only in mi account and google not in phone memoryOver all good handset  camera quality not as 16megapixel bit heating issue  hybrid slot u can use either second sim or SD cardNo other phone can be compared to RN3 with in this price segment and featuresIf any one think its not good den jus gth.
Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.
Its really shocked to see that the hand set can t be operate dual sim if want to use memory card.
Extendable memory won t allow to use two sim cards.
Its describe that it is dual sim with expendable memory.
Either we can use dual sim or single sim with micro SD memory card.
Hybird Slot   If you are using two sim and required memory for you is more then 10 gb than that is a problem for you.
rest all is bestExpandable memory is nil when second sim is used.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
show only 8gb in systemGood but memory card or dual sim problemaftr purchsing cemra gona SSTOP WORKINGare there any hanging or heating issuesGood phone.
One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
Can t use memory card along with duel sim.
I found this con so far  Phone is badass It s value for money Super resolutionDos not hang at allSmoothJust bit heavy in weight n gets heated while chargingone draw back is we cannot use sim2   memory card simutaneously.
its tooo good dudeCan we use dual sim   memory card same timeVery disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good5 STARS for the product and 5 STARS for Amazon delivery service.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
grey n silver are betterMobile having 1slot for both external memory and nano sim.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
As alwys Xiaomi rocks but can be little cheaper as other phone offer same applications  coolpad but charger makes noise   i dont know what to do  pros1 design2 battery3 uicons1  only 2 ports  sim sim or sim   32gb sd card 2  heating while charging3  heating while playing games4  no accessories5  above avg camera6 only 9 gb is free7 ram 800 mb is freeFast delivery  the product is awesome  worth 10K but the only problem is the RAM  I guess MI must start selling 32 GB phones   because this phone  s internal memory occupies 50  of the RAm.
They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.
i thought have good and enough memory but i can t increase memory with dual simIt s a little big for normal hands  also getting metallic finish  gets a bit slippery.
One more thing you can use any one of them second SIM   Memory Card in this phone.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Excellent productYou cant insert dual sim if you want to increase memory b coz you can insert dual sim micro and mini both  or one sim and memry card at one time.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .

Look of the mobile  Battery life  but i dont game  use internet at intervals Disliked   no memory card support with dual sim  hybrid sim card slot   5.
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
dual sim with memory are not available for use.
U have to sacrifice ur choice of instaling second sim or memory card.
And sim card memory card changing or replacing system is quite difficult.
The phone ki very good in condition awesome mobile looks like iPhone 6s plus mobileSir hum isko kaise purchase kare buy now add to cart ka option hi nahi aa rha ismeOne major drawback is that we can use second sim or memory card any one at a timeNice phone in this price range ho gold colour is much better than grey   silver.

flash sales  -8
Guys I think you people are doing a marketing stunt through these flash sales but the point is that as people are getting frustrated not getting one  so effectively you are antagonizing your future customers whereas competitors are grabbing the benefits of the same.
See friends I was also one of you trying to bye this phone  I was very excited BT looking the foolness happened in the first two flash sales I left the thought of buying the phone .
If anybody from team amazon or MI  please think and act accordingly because these flash sales are just useless for your cause.
this flash sales.
And short stock is being covered thru flash sales  of 200.
letv was on flash sales in jan but now its readily avaliable.
Well I ve been trying to get xiaomi redmi note 3 since 16th March waited for all sales like a fool so frustrated with this useless flash sales and most awesome thing happened.
Here in this site I found lots of people gave 1 star of because they dnt know how to purchased from flash sales i used this phone for almost 7 days except little bit of heating it s a very good budget phone to for it guys The phone is heating like a oven at the time of charging and battery backup is not at all good.
ultimate for use  very good productPerfect phone in affordable price I bought 2 handsets 1 silver and another Gold through flash sales.
MI didn t expect this kind of huge demand and that s why there are flash sales.
creating a false hype by these flash sales.
rather than selling in flash sales kindly sell directly so that we do not waste our hours here.
What is the need of flash sales.
I hope all these negative feedbacks are out of frustration because of the flash sales and defective pieces but if you are lucky enough  the smartphone is quite excellent.
If the 32 GB is not in stock please do not fool customers by flash sales.
the flash sales of Xiaomi may be pub.
thode months bad yeh bhi avaliable hoga without any flash sales.
Finally they are selling these phones without flash sales  Thank you Great phone.
Pathetic Flash Sales.
Awesome batteryNice phonewhat redmi want to proove by making available only hundreds of units for flash sales in a country of 130 crores people.

33 GB for a 16GB phone after company installed apps  when using dual sim  we cant use memory card.
One more thing you can use any one of them second SIM   Memory Card in this phone.
It has not clearly mentioned in the phone description that TWO SIM CARDS AND A MEMORY CHIP Card will not work together  which is true.
so that one can use dual sim as well as memory cardPreviously we had redmi 2 it was working well.
if you want use the memory card  SD card you need to use single sim only.
Everyone should buy itCamera Quality is not up to the mark  two SIM or single SIM with memory card option is available  too much heat at chargingRest is best in class specially dinner print sensor  processor etc so Awesome mobile phone at this range.
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
camera quality average  Network issue for BSNL sim card  contact save option only in mi account and google not in phone memoryOver all good handset  camera quality not as 16megapixel bit heating issue  hybrid slot u can use either second sim or SD cardNo other phone can be compared to RN3 with in this price segment and featuresIf any one think its not good den jus gth.
Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.
Its really shocked to see that the hand set can t be operate dual sim if want to use memory card.
Extendable memory won t allow to use two sim cards.
Can t use memory card along with duel sim.
Either we can use dual sim or single sim with micro SD memory card.
we cannot insert both dual sim and a memory card in same time.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
show only 8gb in systemGood but memory card or dual sim problemaftr purchsing cemra gona SSTOP WORKINGare there any hanging or heating issuesGood phone.
One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
its tooo good dudeCan we use dual sim   memory card same timeVery disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good5 STARS for the product and 5 STARS for Amazon delivery service.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.

They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Excellent productYou cant insert dual sim if you want to increase memory b coz you can insert dual sim micro and mini both  or one sim and memry card at one time.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .
Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
Dual SIM function or One Sim and One memory card.
if i use second sim will remove memory card from the device.
Look of the mobile  Battery life  but i dont game  use internet at intervals Disliked   no memory card support with dual sim  hybrid sim card slot   5.
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
U have to sacrifice ur choice of instaling second sim or memory card.
And sim card memory card changing or replacing system is quite difficult.
The phone ki very good in condition awesome mobile looks like iPhone 6s plus mobileSir hum isko kaise purchase kare buy now add to cart ka option hi nahi aa rha ismeOne major drawback is that we can use second sim or memory card any one at a timeNice phone in this price range ho gold colour is much better than grey   silver.

32 gb version  -7
There is a software update out for this phoneGoing to try with the latest update and if it doesn t prove to be useful for the DUAL SIM issue  am gonna return the phoneWTF  32 gb version is not available  and there minuscule number of device available for  16 gb also.
Phone Memory   In case of 16gb version internal unused space is 9gb  so much memory allocated for some pre installed app and Lollipop update.
Fingerprint sensor works wellNo hanging problem after upgrading to latest version.
The earlier version is very simple to use.
Internal memory is an issue  16gb fills up quite fast with few apps and games and 32gb version is out of stock  The phone also does not feature the latest version of Android 6 and also don t know when will it be made available by Xiaomi.
Good But its Taking too Much Memory taking 5 GB internally to run  I think its too much  Better to Go for 32 GB versionI think mi note 3 mobile is very good mobile under 10000camera.
If your budget is no a constraint  then opt for the 32 GB version if you are lucky to get one  otherwise the 16 GB works fine with a 32 GB card put instead of a second sim.
Battery heating issues are also very less after upgrading to the latest mi version.
Still not able to get the 32Gb version redmi note 3.
Dirty game xiaomi   it ain t the best   no 3gb version too .
The initial out of the box miui version is better  the new 7.
Not good phone very hanged phone apps are not running properly camera quality is not good fingerprint sensor not working properlyWanted the grey version.
we want 32gb variant so plz make the 32gb version available in open sales and stop playing that trickAmazon and Xiaomi is Cheating with Peaple2GB 16GB Version is totally a scrap .
I am using this phone has problem of network selection  after moving just 1m areayet I have updated latest version but still facing problemI received this product in days time.
Briliant display camera battary awaysome thanku xiaomiI bought the Gold 16GB variant because I could not wait for the 32GB version any longer.

32gb internal memory without expendable memory may be a biggest issue in feature.
Can t ask for more at this price  Purchased 3 phones in total for my family camera quialty not goodinternal memory not good for user so low total 11.
Phone Memory   In case of 16gb version internal unused space is 9gb  so much memory allocated for some pre installed app and Lollipop update.
Also 16GB internal memory is filled with some preloaded apps  so you cant expect lot of free space  it was 9.
Good Mobile phone in budget range  But internal memory is less for use Product was delivered on time and have no complaints about the phone.

The only drawback is that only 10GB out of 16GB of internal memory is available for use.

3 gb ram  5
On average  you have about 1GB of free RAM available if you only have a single app running.
9 gb free ram.
RAM is 2 GB whereas in the 32 GB variant RAM is 3GB.
2 GB RAM is available.
5 GB memory and in2 GB RAM get 800 MB free memory onlyThis mobile lookwise and costwise is good.
I would have preferred the 32 GB version with 3 GB RAM  but was not lucky to click it in time  as they sold in a couple of seconds.
bt  now itz showing 2GB ram n 16 GB romWithin one month of its purchase the charging port got spoiled  we took it to claim the mfg warranty  it is now 10days  they are claiming that it might take another 10 days.
currently available 16gb and 2gb ram.
in the 16gb variant  almost 6 gb is taken by os specially having MIUIgo for 32gb 3gb ram if heavy storage requiredGiving in this price range it is not satisfying  lagging a lot during hd video playback  camera quality is not as expected as 16mp  front camera is good enough  battery backup and screen quality is good  RAM management is very poor it gives you only 50  of the RAM and the remaing is consumed by its internal applications the only best thing i found in this handset is only the fingerprint scanner and nothing else.
1GB of RAM is available initially then it gradually depletes to 700.
Though this phone comes with Snapdragon processor and 2 gbs of ram  its very disappointing to say its not up to its mark.
Fingerprint scanner not working properlysuperb phoneif you budget of under 10000 this is the best buyThree 3gb ram means system get heat it is after small device Every one is choosing this mobile in internet also it is best mobile below 10000.
LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
Most important the internal storage is only 9GB in 16GB and RAM is less than 900MB in 2GB very disappointed by this.
All this nonse about 3 GB RAM being the best is rubbish.
7. out of 2gb ram only 1gb free.
In antu 2gb ram has scored 70920 change.
in 2gb version ram is usable less than 950mb.
1  gb of ram is available .
big screen size 2 GB ram is nice.
and around 950 mb ram is free out of 2gb.
Very nice  but 32 GB ver is bettergaram ho rha h want to replace disSpeker sound quality is very poor.
Available RAM in this model is only 750 850 MB out of 2GB  in normal condition without additional apps installation.

Most of the people asking for 32 GB version with 3 GB Ram but i am lucky to have one in first sale only.
Although camera could have been better and 3Gb Ram would have been an icing on the cake.

Hugh barro is really a smart guy who knows how to fool indians smartly and we the people of great india fall into butter words of foreigners easily.
Atleast google it you dumb people  Also Xiaomi doesn t say  Redmi note 3 Dual    anybody with decent brains can understand that.
Some people  may think it looks too flashy it s wrong.
now it says  No registration need  as this was the first phone with good specifications   price but now its Lenovo ZUK Z1   Moto G4 Plus   people have already bought what was available.
One of the best phone at this price rangeMany people are not able to purchase through flash sale in amazon  So try to purchase in MI Web site which I purchased another phone through there website today.
Good phone however Xiomi and Amazon forcing people to go with 2 16 GB version  that s not fair let people decide what they want to purchase.

print sensor works  5
its better optionTo much heat problem cant use continuesly more than 1hr finger print sensor is to good but main problem is u cant use 2sim  if u had a memory card in slotSoft ware got crushed within 1 and half months of purchasejust awesome phone it is unexpectable.
metal body looks classic fringerprint sensor is not absolute but still.
Dual sim  Works  but not practical as its a hybrid sim slot.
Finger print sensor is superb and battery backup is also superb but some heating issue  in phone.
But not happy with the sensor provided on the back.
The fingerprint sensor present on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is a great sensor with a RESPONSE TIME of about 0.
Fingerprint sensor is outstanding.
it is commendable backup for daily user  best feature is fingerprint sensor opens phone in 3 sec.
It works very long and the screen is too good it has a very active light sensor it also works very good and I get notification that your mobile will come in 13.
Finger sensor and play store stop working when we download IMO applicationHe he he.
Fingerprint sensor is very accurate.
Its stylish to holdIt has nice  themFinger print scanner is  awesome.
fingerprint sensor works very good.
2. finger print sensor is nice.
screen  resolution  is mind blowingdesign  is goodfinger sensor.
Finger print is great too.
Pocket  sensor also available where u can avoid unnecessary contacts when  u keep ur mobile inside the pocket  I don t know why rating is going down of this  mobile.
Sometimes fingerprint sensor just cannot unlock and have to use code to unlock.
3 sec  But in reality its a hectic job to unlock thru finger print sensor so i use to power button and then only i use finger print.
looks are decent nd fingerprint sensor is amazing.
works perfect looks awesome.
Finger sensor is just awesome and superfast  though i wish that finger lock feature should also have been there.
the fingerprint sensor is awesome and ease of access.
Awsom phone works very good with awsom touch and also very fast on it gets heated very fast but all other things are good.
It was amazingGift to friendMobl is so nicPlayed 32gb miIts so good but dznt hv handfreemi mobie is overall good but ther is mobile thertening problem ie network problem tat is the worst thing and the  fingerprint sensor is worst which unlocks the screen after clicking the power button.

second sim  5
WowSD card cant be inserted if u use a second sim.
Then removed the second sim and it worked fineOther features are excellent  but for this one.
But my second sim slot is not working.
One more thing you can use any one of them second SIM   Memory Card in this phone.
second sim is not working   supporting.
rest all is bestExpandable memory is nil when second sim is used.
only one problem in the phone there is two sim slots but second sim slot is not working   if u use the memory card then it access   this phone is usually used for one sim.
And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
if i use second sim will remove memory card from the device.
if you will try to insert second sim then both sim does not work.
If your budget is no a constraint  then opt for the 32 GB version if you are lucky to get one  otherwise the 16 GB works fine with a 32 GB card put instead of a second sim.
On the second sim it says  No Service .
manufacturing defect  secondly network problem for the 1st sim slot and though there is sim in the second sim slot  it showing emergency calls only I LL GIVE 2.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
camera quality average  Network issue for BSNL sim card  contact save option only in mi account and google not in phone memoryOver all good handset  camera quality not as 16megapixel bit heating issue  hybrid slot u can use either second sim or SD cardNo other phone can be compared to RN3 with in this price segment and featuresIf any one think its not good den jus gth.
U have to sacrifice ur choice of instaling second sim or memory card.
Hybrid sim slot for second sim micro SD card .

sim card slot  -5
only one problem in the phone there is two sim slots but second sim slot is not working   if u use the memory card then it access   this phone is usually used for one sim.

Rest everything is quite impressive But it not had an extra slot for micro SD card .
SIM card slot    It has a hybrid card slot in which one is a microsim slot   other is either a sim  nano  or a microSD card slot.
one problem with this phone is that there is no slot available after inserting both SIM.
It s an awesome phone and hv a premium  look camera is OK battery is good  only problem is memory and sim  slot Dere is only two slots either  u can put memory card or sim.
Hybrid slot not suitable for someGood UINo lagsNice buildCamera are goodAudio output is acceptable over ear phones its goodBattery backup is awesomeeverything is ok but front camera is not working.
The camera is bad  the first sim slot doesnt work at all inspite of several reboots.
Dual sim  Works  but not practical as its a hybrid sim slot.
I didnot check sim2 and used memory card in second slot which also worked fine.
rectified in future updateshybrid slot.
The sim tray has a slot for a micro sim as the primary sim and a second hybrid sim slot.
But my second sim slot is not working.
It s specified that it has dual 4G SIM slot but only slot one is 4G compatible and it is not hot swapable.
My sim slots are not working properly because of which i change the sim card also due to which i lost my all contacts.
basically the sim slot is defective after replacement it s again defective.
Fake Redmi Note 3. can t use SD card and Sim2 slot same time.
Sim slot is disappointing.
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
Look of the mobile  Battery life  but i dont game  use internet at intervals Disliked   no memory card support with dual sim  hybrid sim card slot   5.
but 2nd sim and memory card have single slot so that you can use eigther 2nd sim or memory card.
Common slot of sim and Memory card2.
Looking forward to get more MI products Pros  build  display  fast no hangs  no heat responsive finger printCons  no dedicated slot for micro SD.
but i havent got any answers yetSecond sim and memory card slot is same which was not mentioned in item description.
One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
I used this mobile for full day with wifi but there is no heating issueCONSphone gets overheating while chargingHybrid sim slotExcept heating up while charging the mobile is awesomeamazing smart phone in  bugetThe best phone at best price.

SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Hybrid sim slot for second sim micro SD card .
Unable to open the SIM slot.
Much better product with all necessery options like dual sim  dedicated mem card slot etc.
i like itVery goodExcellentExcellentTooo goodGood VerySatisfiedExcellentExcellentvery niceVary disappointed for 32gb variantI have got this product today but  not satisfied due to less space as committed by its ads and if u are using duel sim than u don t have any space for  insurt the memory card in same slot.

xiaomi redmi note  -5
So please I request u to sell Redmi Note 3 32 gb version openly or provide me it directly so that I can capture remaing one month of my college life.
Dont buy this phoneIt is working fine and really impressed by Amazon service and but video recording clarity is not good battery is great and finger print sensor is goodRedmi note 3 is fantastic mobile this mobile battery backup is amazingCamera is not that much good.
Internal memory is an issue  16gb fills up quite fast with few apps and games and 32gb version is out of stock  The phone also does not feature the latest version of Android 6 and also don t know when will it be made available by Xiaomi.
I am fed up of Xiaomi unable to provide the 32GB variant  finally bought Lenovo K4 note.
With 2Gb ram  its a slow phoneBest mobile 2016 in this priceits worst then my expectationsredmi Note 3 is exlent mobile.
Hi Guys  I have started to use loved Redmi Note 3 and it s amazing for overall performance and its features.
My new Redmi note 3 was not able to turn on wifi after 15.
Super featuresjust awesome Camera is bestCamera problem solve just download open camera app  photo and video quality awesom get4k uhd video recording experiencre redmi note3 rocksSuperb phone.
Brightness levels are really impressive and a great improvement over the previous Redmi Note  3G 4G .
4  The MIUI on the Redmi Note 3 is bloatware free and receives regular updates while the ROMs on the other devices is bloated and updates are not frequent.
redmi note 3 the best.
Very bad product camera quality is very bad and not support dual sim with micro SD cardBest phone in 10000 range ths phone performance is superb camera quality greatnd screenSpecifications claim like full HD and 16mp camera  is far below the standard in redimi note 3.
5hrs and the battery is getting REALLY HOT  which I have never seen in Note 4G or other mobile I have used till date.
My PERSONAL SUGGESTION if you are die hard xiaomi fan or have enough time to test phone get it replaced  check each and evwry feature and waste lots of time then buy itUnbelievable and It s amazing product.
Yes its true some of redmi note 3 phone get heated but luckily not mine.
I purchased 16 gb variant but it is only providing 8 gb as effective storage i can say a big fraud please do not purchase it If you think hear heating problem has been rectified by Xiaomi in xiaomi redmi note 3  then you are wrong like me.
On the other side Letv1s is doing good and will be happy if amazon xiaomi not launched 32 Gb variant soon.
i hate this xiaomi phone .
The screen display size is same as note 4G  display quality also looks same as note 4G.
Waiting for next Xiaomi Redmi 3.
UI This was a disappointmen  Xiaomi simply hasn t optimized MIUI enough for the 2 gig variant i feel  during heavy multitasking  there were quite a few times the UI got unloaded off the RAM  at first i thought it because of the scarcity of RAM but when i went ahead to clear the RAM there was about 400 MB still free  after that it was clear that it s an optimisation issue  i did recieve an update but it did no good on that front.
it would b better for xiaomi to choose flipkart as its consignee   now i understand.
very nice redmi note 3quality fone.
The company has to give more attention to that and getting merely update is not a good one and we expect more from Redmi.
unlocking  is very difficult  xiaomi is trying hard to curtaile down customers with this verry bad move  if ur not going to install custom roms  root this is best phone in 10 k   oh cam is average.
32 gb wale ko apne g m bhr le mc bcHeats up too muchAverage phone in 10k priceDon t expect everything is good in this phoneIt s a cool gadget of redmi note 3 but  16gb  is not i think good is there 16gb internal and sim is nano is risky for insert sim in cell so i think 32gb cellphone is good.
Its fast but multitasking not good as 3gb versionCamera qualitiy of redmi 2 is better than this phone.
Horrible handset  even after changing  problem exists  any1 from amazon can help me sort dis issueGreat amazing feeling to see my favorite redmi note 3 .
Initially  I am hesitate to purchase Redmi products due to heating issue but there is no problem  so far.
so phone is not good   it is trueAnyone want redmi 3 worth 9999contact me  917349343883 only Bangalorewtf man  what about 32gb handset.
Feels considerably lighter and slimmer than the previous Redmi Note 4G.
The phone was amazing but its front camera I don t understand y is blurrr and IMO is not connecting camera any one nows so plzz tell me ane U can use both sim but no memory and alot one is damage my simXiaomi note 3 is so sleek looking.
PS  this is not a paid review   a true xiaomi fan   Have fun It s getting so heat.
Purchased Lenovo K4 Note and very much satisfied with that.
Avrege phone i am not a fan of this  fhone   network problemCamera  is not godProcessor  is so goodRedmi note 4g is better  to  this  phoneFirst of all best service by AMAZONFaster delivery then estimated date on sunday also working and properly packed.
alweys heats phoneFinally I was successful in grabbing a Redmi Note 3 after many tries.
Redmi note 3 gold 2GB RAM 16GB storage  this hand set is thinner  lighter and slightly shorter in length compared to Redmi Note 4G available with me.
thanks to the 4000mah battery  Loud speaker is better than the previous   Redmi Note Mi4 and Mi4i  mobiles and earphone output is also improved over the previous mobiles.
You may buy it without any hesitationRedmi note 3 is Perfect phone.
4hours before sell   keep refreshing it and u will get any model good luck and I am waiting for my rn3this is average phone due to camera quality but all over goodand i think Meizu m3 note is better than thisWe have decided to stop shopping with Amazon because of the Redmi Note 3 sale.
As alwys Xiaomi rocks but can be little cheaper as other phone offer same applications  coolpad but charger makes noise   i dont know what to do  pros1 design2 battery3 uicons1  only 2 ports  sim sim or sim   32gb sd card 2  heating while charging3  heating while playing games4  no accessories5  above avg camera6 only 9 gb is free7 ram 800 mb is freeFast delivery  the product is awesome  worth 10K but the only problem is the RAM  I guess MI must start selling 32 GB phones   because this phone  s internal memory occupies 50  of the RAm.
Android Skin used by Xiaomi is very heavy on the system.
Great phone by Xiaomi  too good at this price.
Worst marketing techniqueredmi note 3  is excellent .
I feel that my REDMI 1S guves a better performance than REDMI NOTE 3EswarCamera is just average.
Not good Xiaomi.
in serviceIt is hanging in between and switching offI love mi note 3 but i want 32 gb pls sellOsm mob vit such a low price.
Really disappointement after using the setZooming redmi note 3 iIbought  one week back   it s nice to use all feature  like  iPhone  6sDropped phone not working right and main when it felt body bent badly.
I was used to being able to reach the entire screen with one hand which is not possible with the Note 3 and you have to jiggle the phone in your hand or use 2 hands.
Some time phone was slow showing wait for a second Overall note 3 is good.
I received my Xiaomi redme note 3 on 04th April which i booked through flashsale on 30th March.
Hello Amazon and friends I would like to share my feedback on this xiaomi worst mobile.
awesomeSlow motion and Time lapse option in camera is awesome Video quality little bad Redmi Note 3 is the only phone which takes care of all the needs in the Budget phone segmentBest battery  Dual Sim  4G Sleek design.
ltv had a very bad exposure in the day light but hdr on redmi is good.
Only after purchasing did i notice the bad reviews people gave for this phone in GSMArena because of the heating problems   Please dont buy this untill Xiaomi provides a SW update patch for this.
UI same as other Redmi with some top.
great phone with great looks the beast has arrived  I had many confusions when i thought to purchase redmi as some said that mobile gets heated up so fastly but i purchased on 27th april i was very happy and i am totally satisfied with the features.
Redmi 1S is far better than this.
amazon is very fast delivery i like this so much mi note 3 aswome  rocking but thing is battary is not removabal so badWorst flash sale ever.
sony set are lower and other proab lem  when charging redmi is very heating .
I m really glad that I waited to buy this instead of coolpad note 3 and Asus max .
Though I did not really expect Note 3 to do better  but thought it would be equal which it is not.
it heats a lot  even you feel it in your pocket like a hot iron slabOver heating problem  the phone was very heating charging time calling timeRedmi note 3  loaded with good features like Mi remote battery backup 2nd sim slot but oftenly rotate button switching automatically keyboard changing every time  3 gb MODEL without stock REGISTRATIONS ARE company got remarks .

with sd card  4
Sending contact card is not user friendly  Guess need to wait for few months of usage to knopw its true colors as am not into gaming or heavy downloads or viewing videos.
External SD card is allowed in sim card slot but not tested yet3.
6. sometimes youtube video takes to start from the beging while amid of watching those and that gets resolved when i try changing the volume using volume button  7. sim card port total two ports  one is solely sturcturized for nano sim another can be either used for sd card or can b used for another sim that is highly disadvantagous who wants to keep two sim as well as the sd card so i chose sims over sd card and now my sd card is of no use  The phone is a mark of beauty.
Either we can use dual sim or single sim with micro SD memory card.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Product is good  if it is having seperate  slot for memory card  removable battery option  sim insert slot is  still best phonei received faulty unit  with no volumes coming from speaker  so i had to return and im awaiting for the refund since last monthGuys  this seller sends item without quality check.
Can not put dual sim and micro sd card with the same.
My sim slots are not working properly because of which i change the sim card also due to which i lost my all contacts.
And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
FM Radio reception is not greatDrawback was both sim and micro sd card not inserted and also it was not mention in redme mobile manualNice phone redmi note 3 32gbCamera color quality is poorVery Nice mobile worth full.
In the hybrid sim slot a nano sim can be used or a micro SD card upto 32GB storage.
Also there is no manual or guaranty card.
It s an awesome phone and hv a premium  look camera is OK battery is good  only problem is memory and sim  slot Dere is only two slots either  u can put memory card or sim.

It has not clearly mentioned in the phone description that TWO SIM CARDS AND A MEMORY CHIP Card will not work together  which is true.
4 Star only because  not able to insert micro SD card along with two Simcards.
we cant use sd card with dual sim cards.

LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.

Extendable memory won t allow to use two sim cards.

all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.

Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .

delivery by amazon  4
The customer care support of amazon is though commendable as they quickly escalated the matter once i called them on monday.
Amazon was truly co. operative and helpful with every process.
amazon u really disappointed me.

Worse still  Amazon is not accepting request for replacement and are asking me to send a mail or talk to Mi Service.
no such lag noticed tilll amazon service is also goodHi I bought the phone thru olx.
this is better thanPackage reached in perfect condition phone working extremely goodI want to go with this productbut I am waging 32 GB versionAgain a fast delivery and good service by amazonredmi note3 exceptionally doing well.
Vvvv bad camera qualityIn many reviews its  has been said camera is average and there is heating problem but I cannot give a negative feed back  regarding any aspect  a great front cam which is 100 elgible for the tag  self  expert and  and bateery lasts for appromatily 3days  friends without a second thought go for itVery good mobile   10k  metal body finishing  of the product is top notch  and also the impressive Amazon s product delivery.
Though the experience with amazon was excellent the product has failed to satisfy.
having good features one should definately go for this phone i would like to thank amazon for selling such a great product good as expected But there are few problems like Finger print sensor doe not work while in charging mode and sometimes it does nt work at all.
Earlier i thought this problem is with my particular mobile set so i contacted amazon and get my mobile replaced but the problem remains same with other replaced mobile also.
Not happy with Amazon return policyNot Happy with over all performance ofMi Note 3 16Gb MobileHang S alotHeating issueFinger print not works all timeAwesome phoneRedmi note 3 gives a premium and good in looks.
Already people are looking for other better option and if 32 Gb variant is not come asap I am sure amazon will also get impacted due to this.
And good and safest delivery by amazon .
amazon really disappointed this timeTypical Chinese market stuff.
My infrared bluster is not workingas i am reading the amazon exclusive customer feedbacks who have bought this device and comparing this device discription to some another cheap devices  i dont think that the device will work fineBest phone under Rs.

one sim and  -4
Then removed the second sim and it worked fineOther features are excellent  but for this one.
This Phone Worths The Every Penny You Spend On iti got the 16 gb variant   i was not able to get 32gbThough 16gb is not a problem  but 2g ram is a little bit problem  as the phone has only about 800 mb ram free to use  still it is sufficient if you are not a very heavy useradvantages  its huge monsterous 4050mah battery which can easily last for a full day after heavy usageits display which produces very crispy and sharp colours  video  photo and all other things looks good on phone   viewing angles are good toofinger print sensor works amazingly  its very responsivemi ui is one of the best ui  you have so many customizations in your phone which makes the phone really coolits dual sim  so you can have two sims in the phonedisadvantages  2 gb ram is not enough if you are a heavy user   phone can lag a bit  but if you are a normal user then ram is not a problem at allabout camera  camera clicks decent pics  both back and front cam takes decent pics in good light  its above averageheating issues  i have not find any heating issues so far  i played several games  but the phone did not get hot very much .
I recommend those who only use single sim should go for 16GB version and we all people wont use a phone for more than a year or 2.
this phone not a dual sim is a singal sim because same time memory card   sim 2 both eligible are not use in same   battery is not removable   other earphone is not working this deviceNice phone with great features and specifications.
sound speaker sounds above average   they are loud and clear  headphone output is really nice  i will recoomend you to use mi sound enhancer plus change setting in audio section if you are using high end headphoneswifi   network  wifi   dual sim works fine so far and have no issuesOVERALL CONCLUSION  THE 32 GB VARIANT SEEMS OUT OF STOCK  AND WILL TAKE TIME TO GET BACK IN STOCK  BUT STILL IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THE 16 GB VARIANT   GO WITH IT BLINDLY   IT WORTH THE PRICE  ITS STILL BETTER THAN K4 NOTE AND LETV LE 1S IN MOST OF ASPECTSIF I WILL FIND ANY OTHER PROBLEMS IN FUTURE   I WILL SURELY WRITE ABOUT ITThe mobile is good very good battery backupbut received no accessories with it  for 10k rupees    Microphone stops working randomly.
An issue with inserting dual sim and memory card and the phone heated up with a longer use.
Excellent productYou cant insert dual sim if you want to increase memory b coz you can insert dual sim micro and mini both  or one sim and memry card at one time.
It s specified that it has dual 4G SIM slot but only slot one is 4G compatible and it is not hot swapable.
Very disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good at allDamage product on 28 3 but still not refund or replacement provide think twice before buyThis phone is gud one  dual sim  but the use of two sim or one sim plus memmory card is a draw back.
Dual SIM function or One Sim and One memory card.
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
32 gb wale ko apne g m bhr le mc bcHeats up too muchAverage phone in 10k priceDon t expect everything is good in this phoneIt s a cool gadget of redmi note 3 but  16gb  is not i think good is there 16gb internal and sim is nano is risky for insert sim in cell so i think 32gb cellphone is good.
But 16gb is very less And also the phone has hybrid dual sim to put sd card hence 16gb is very very less if you put have sim to insert.
Very bad product camera quality is very bad and not support dual sim with micro SD cardBest phone in 10000 range ths phone performance is superb camera quality greatnd screenSpecifications claim like full HD and 16mp camera  is far below the standard in redimi note 3.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
After receiving on 23rd May 2016 today is 8th of June 2016 I am not been able to do anything with this mobile not getting my money back to purchase the other model of this and use the new 4g sim which is lost almost its data pack.
Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.
camera quality average  Network issue for BSNL sim card  contact save option only in mi account and google not in phone memoryOver all good handset  camera quality not as 16megapixel bit heating issue  hybrid slot u can use either second sim or SD cardNo other phone can be compared to RN3 with in this price segment and featuresIf any one think its not good den jus gth.

Be care full for dual sims and sd card  it can single sim and sd card Or dual sim.
it s been explicitly stated that it supports dual sim OR a sim and an SD card.
Can not put dual sim and micro sd card with the same.
FM Radio reception is not greatDrawback was both sim and micro sd card not inserted and also it was not mention in redme mobile manualNice phone redmi note 3 32gbCamera color quality is poorVery Nice mobile worth full.
But 16gb is very less And also the phone has hybrid dual sim to put sd card hence 16gb is very very less if you put have sim to insert.
Works for only single SIM and sd card or dual sims at a time.
I enjoy it  we want 32gb storage in open saleWhen we are charging this mobile its heated so muchNo dual SIM facility with sd card at same timeU cant use two sims and a sd card together.
dual sim and sd card does not work together.
The problem is that u not able put Sim 2 and Micro SD together or mismatch  functionality  or either both Sim active either 1 Sim  active  and Micro SD.

sim sd card  4
WowSD card cant be inserted if u use a second sim.
one sim is nano sim  one sim is small sim  you may have to sacrifice one sim if you want to use a memory card for expansion.
Its a dual sim card phone.
only one problem in the phone there is two sim slots but second sim slot is not working   if u use the memory card then it access   this phone is usually used for one sim.
An issue with inserting dual sim and memory card and the phone heated up with a longer use.
Product is good  if it is having seperate  slot for memory card  removable battery option  sim insert slot is  still best phonei received faulty unit  with no volumes coming from speaker  so i had to return and im awaiting for the refund since last monthGuys  this seller sends item without quality check.
Can not put dual sim and micro sd card with the same.
And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
Disadvantage is we cant use  2 Sim with Memory card on sametimeExecellent work done by u.
In the hybrid sim slot a nano sim can be used or a micro SD card upto 32GB storage.
Ys its the only issue wit me  it should hv suportd dual sim wit a micro sd card.
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
If we want to use dual sim  we need to remove sd card first.
It s an awesome phone and hv a premium  look camera is OK battery is good  only problem is memory and sim  slot Dere is only two slots either  u can put memory card or sim.
Very bad product camera quality is very bad and not support dual sim with micro SD cardBest phone in 10000 range ths phone performance is superb camera quality greatnd screenSpecifications claim like full HD and 16mp camera  is far below the standard in redimi note 3.
6. sometimes youtube video takes to start from the beging while amid of watching those and that gets resolved when i try changing the volume using volume button  7. sim card port total two ports  one is solely sturcturized for nano sim another can be either used for sd card or can b used for another sim that is highly disadvantagous who wants to keep two sim as well as the sd card so i chose sims over sd card and now my sd card is of no use  The phone is a mark of beauty.
4 Star only because  not able to insert micro SD card along with two Simcards.

One more thing you can use any one of them second SIM   Memory Card in this phone.
it s been explicitly stated that it supports dual sim OR a sim and an SD card.
It has not clearly mentioned in the phone description that TWO SIM CARDS AND A MEMORY CHIP Card will not work together  which is true.
My sim slots are not working properly because of which i change the sim card also due to which i lost my all contacts.
we cannot insert both dual sim and a memory card in same time.
so that one can use dual sim as well as memory cardPreviously we had redmi 2 it was working well.
FM Radio reception is not greatDrawback was both sim and micro sd card not inserted and also it was not mention in redme mobile manualNice phone redmi note 3 32gbCamera color quality is poorVery Nice mobile worth full.
But 16gb is very less And also the phone has hybrid dual sim to put sd card hence 16gb is very very less if you put have sim to insert.
if you want use the memory card  SD card you need to use single sim only.
Everyone should buy itCamera Quality is not up to the mark  two SIM or single SIM with memory card option is available  too much heat at chargingRest is best in class specially dinner print sensor  processor etc so Awesome mobile phone at this range.
Be care full for dual sims and sd card  it can single sim and sd card Or dual sim.
Look of the mobile  Battery life  but i dont game  use internet at intervals Disliked   no memory card support with dual sim  hybrid sim card slot   5.
Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.

The second sim card slot is not working.
its tooo good dudeCan we use dual sim   memory card same timeVery disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good5 STARS for the product and 5 STARS for Amazon delivery service.
But  i facing some problem i. e. the phone is hang again and again without insert sim card and charger of the same is not functioning proper.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
But there is a problem u can use either dual sim or sd card .
Dual sim   sd card will not work at same time.
They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.
Hi friends   any one who wants dual sim along with sd card don t buy this mobile  this is.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.

Dual SIM function or One Sim and One memory card.
if i use second sim will remove memory card from the device.
If your budget is no a constraint  then opt for the 32 GB version if you are lucky to get one  otherwise the 16 GB works fine with a 32 GB card put instead of a second sim.
Much better product with all necessery options like dual sim  dedicated mem card slot etc.
U have to sacrifice ur choice of instaling second sim or memory card.
Hybrid sim slot for second sim micro SD card .
The phone ki very good in condition awesome mobile looks like iPhone 6s plus mobileSir hum isko kaise purchase kare buy now add to cart ka option hi nahi aa rha ismeOne major drawback is that we can use second sim or memory card any one at a timeNice phone in this price range ho gold colour is much better than grey   silver.

finger print sensor  4
its better optionTo much heat problem cant use continuesly more than 1hr finger print sensor is to good but main problem is u cant use 2sim  if u had a memory card in slotSoft ware got crushed within 1 and half months of purchasejust awesome phone it is unexpectable.
Even after lots of search and troubleshooting  i am not able to configure the Finger touch sensorBest mobile for gaming and camera is quite good for the price point battery around 2 days from normal usage high usage 1 day awesome build qualityPhone is good in its appearance otherwise it has worst camera quality in MI phone ever have  occasionally hang  over heat  fingerprint sensor failed.
Finger sensor is just awesome and superfast  though i wish that finger lock feature should also have been there.
I thought it could be due to multiple attempts with wrong finger or accidental touches  no it is not.
Finger scannr works awesome.
Tap your registered finger and its alive.
Finger print sensor is superb and battery backup is also superb but some heating issue  in phone.
The fingerprint sensor present on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 is a great sensor with a RESPONSE TIME of about 0.
But i found that sometimes  very rare  finger print sensor is not working.
Fingerprint sensor is outstanding.
i am using xiaomi Radmi Note 3 for last one month my experience with it is that it is indeed a perfect smart phoneBest phone at this priceLook is perfect finger print sensor is fastGood camera and great video claritySuperb mobile I had ever seen .
it is commendable backup for daily user  best feature is fingerprint sensor opens phone in 3 sec.
There was a software update problem bit now it is working finephone is really lives up to its expectation the screen is good and touch is quite responsive especially its fingerprint sensor is blazing ly fast andabout the specs its written every where  you can go to mi official website or gsmarena   but one thing is the camera don t include the feature oftaking the photo s tapping the finger print sensorThe phone is amzing excepting Camera .
Fingerprint sensor is very accurate.
Its stylish to holdIt has nice  themFinger print scanner is  awesome.
fingerprint sensor works very good.
Xiaomi Redmi Note 3  Gold  is pretty good finger print sensor  battery  grip and voice but camera  both front and back  are not upto the mark.
2. finger print sensor is nice.
Finger print is great too.
Rest all good the phone build is strong  looks good  finger scanner works like a charm.
Sometimes fingerprint sensor just cannot unlock and have to use code to unlock.
3 sec  But in reality its a hectic job to unlock thru finger print sensor so i use to power button and then only i use finger print.
looks are decent nd fingerprint sensor is amazing.
Next Finger print Sensor Mi promises it unlock the Phone in 0.
the fingerprint sensor is awesome and ease of access.
Excellent battery backup and a fast finger print scanner.
It was amazingGift to friendMobl is so nicPlayed 32gb miIts so good but dznt hv handfreemi mobie is overall good but ther is mobile thertening problem ie network problem tat is the worst thing and the  fingerprint sensor is worst which unlocks the screen after clicking the power button.

polarized sunglass  -4
The phone when viewed through a polarized sunglass  Rayban  in portrait mode  which is the way 95  of the times you would be holding your phone  you cant see the display on the screen.
Since most of the time you would be using the phone in portrait mode  using this phone wearing a polarized sunglass would be absolutely not possible.
I have tried viewing it using another branded polarized sunglass too.

at price range  -4
Trust me can t ask for anything more at this unbelievable price range.
Gud mobile In this price  rangenyc product at this low price.

And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
It s an awesome phone and hv a premium  look camera is OK battery is good  only problem is memory and sim  slot Dere is only two slots either  u can put memory card or sim.
But a sdcard if possible it will help the cell a lot for extra memory .
I didnot check sim2 and used memory card in second slot which also worked fine.
33 GB for a 16GB phone after company installed apps  when using dual sim  we cant use memory card.
LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
Extendable memory won t allow to use two sim cards.
Can t use memory card along with duel sim.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
its tooo good dudeCan we use dual sim   memory card same timeVery disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good5 STARS for the product and 5 STARS for Amazon delivery service.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
The case is if you want to insert second sim you can t insert memory card.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
As alwys Xiaomi rocks but can be little cheaper as other phone offer same applications  coolpad but charger makes noise   i dont know what to do  pros1 design2 battery3 uicons1  only 2 ports  sim sim or sim   32gb sd card 2  heating while charging3  heating while playing games4  no accessories5  above avg camera6 only 9 gb is free7 ram 800 mb is freeFast delivery  the product is awesome  worth 10K but the only problem is the RAM  I guess MI must start selling 32 GB phones   because this phone  s internal memory occupies 50  of the RAm.
It has not clearly mentioned in the phone description that TWO SIM CARDS AND A MEMORY CHIP Card will not work together  which is true.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .
Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
And sim card memory card changing or replacing system is quite difficult.
--------------------------------------------------------
micro sd card  4
Either we can use dual sim or single sim with micro SD memory card.
Can not put dual sim and micro sd card with the same.
FM Radio reception is not greatDrawback was both sim and micro sd card not inserted and also it was not mention in redme mobile manualNice phone redmi note 3 32gbCamera color quality is poorVery Nice mobile worth full.
In the hybrid sim slot a nano sim can be used or a micro SD card upto 32GB storage.

Here in this site I found lots of people gave 1 star of because they dnt know how to purchased from flash sales i used this phone for almost 7 days except little bit of heating it s a very good budget phone to for it guys The phone is heating like a oven at the time of charging and battery backup is not at all good.
i received an MIUI update today  after update phone was heating a little bit.
The other thing which is a little bit overstated is the camera.
Mobile is a little bit big for maybe small hands.
Nice phone but compare to MI3 it s little bit slow.
Phone is heating little bit while using multiple apps continuously.
The phone gets a little bit hotter when charging and another problem is that the camera is not good enough inside the room but it is a good product for this price go for it5 5 battery 3 5 camera 4 5 looks 5 5 finger print scanner 4 5 screen  in all it s been a good experience and a Worth buying for 10kNice phone.
But a little bit problem of heating while charging of your phone but it cooled quickly when you remove your charger.
The only cons are that it heats little bit faster after the casual use and also while charging.
i thought have good and enough memory but i can t increase memory with dual simIt s a little big for normal hands  also getting metallic finish  gets a bit slippery.
The little bit issue in device getting by charge it getting warm.
5. little bit heating issue while browsing and talking.
Cant wait now  3gb a dream now buzz of chinese huggoPhone is good but camera  finger scanner is not goodLittle bit of problem when call is ended white screen is displaying for a while then return to home page.

I recommend those who only use single sim should go for 16GB version and we all people wont use a phone for more than a year or 2.
this phone not a dual sim is a singal sim because same time memory card   sim 2 both eligible are not use in same   battery is not removable   other earphone is not working this deviceNice phone with great features and specifications.
sound speaker sounds above average   they are loud and clear  headphone output is really nice  i will recoomend you to use mi sound enhancer plus change setting in audio section if you are using high end headphoneswifi   network  wifi   dual sim works fine so far and have no issuesOVERALL CONCLUSION  THE 32 GB VARIANT SEEMS OUT OF STOCK  AND WILL TAKE TIME TO GET BACK IN STOCK  BUT STILL IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO BUY THE 16 GB VARIANT   GO WITH IT BLINDLY   IT WORTH THE PRICE  ITS STILL BETTER THAN K4 NOTE AND LETV LE 1S IN MOST OF ASPECTSIF I WILL FIND ANY OTHER PROBLEMS IN FUTURE   I WILL SURELY WRITE ABOUT ITThe mobile is good very good battery backupbut received no accessories with it  for 10k rupees    Microphone stops working randomly.
so purchasing 32 gb variant is a good idea for dual sim usersMain problem of this phone is .
so that one can use dual sim as well as memory cardPreviously we had redmi 2 it was working well.
Disadvantage is we cant use  2 Sim with Memory card on sametimeExecellent work done by u.
Very disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good at allDamage product on 28 3 but still not refund or replacement provide think twice before buyThis phone is gud one  dual sim  but the use of two sim or one sim plus memmory card is a draw back.
I enjoy it  we want 32gb storage in open saleWhen we are charging this mobile its heated so muchNo dual SIM facility with sd card at same timeU cant use two sims and a sd card together.
After receiving on 23rd May 2016 today is 8th of June 2016 I am not been able to do anything with this mobile not getting my money back to purchase the other model of this and use the new 4g sim which is lost almost its data pack.

My new Redmi note 3 was not able to turn on wifi after 15.
alweys heats phoneFinally I was successful in grabbing a Redmi Note 3 after many tries.
4  The MIUI on the Redmi Note 3 is bloatware free and receives regular updates while the ROMs on the other devices is bloated and updates are not frequent.
thanks to the 4000mah battery  Loud speaker is better than the previous   Redmi Note Mi4 and Mi4i  mobiles and earphone output is also improved over the previous mobiles.
Feels considerably lighter and slimmer than the previous Redmi Note 4G.
4hours before sell   keep refreshing it and u will get any model good luck and I am waiting for my rn3this is average phone due to camera quality but all over goodand i think Meizu m3 note is better than thisWe have decided to stop shopping with Amazon because of the Redmi Note 3 sale.

only one sim  -3
This Phone Worths The Every Penny You Spend On iti got the 16 gb variant   i was not able to get 32gbThough 16gb is not a problem  but 2g ram is a little bit problem  as the phone has only about 800 mb ram free to use  still it is sufficient if you are not a very heavy useradvantages  its huge monsterous 4050mah battery which can easily last for a full day after heavy usageits display which produces very crispy and sharp colours  video  photo and all other things looks good on phone   viewing angles are good toofinger print sensor works amazingly  its very responsivemi ui is one of the best ui  you have so many customizations in your phone which makes the phone really coolits dual sim  so you can have two sims in the phonedisadvantages  2 gb ram is not enough if you are a heavy user   phone can lag a bit  but if you are a normal user then ram is not a problem at allabout camera  camera clicks decent pics  both back and front cam takes decent pics in good light  its above averageheating issues  i have not find any heating issues so far  i played several games  but the phone did not get hot very much .
I recommend those who only use single sim should go for 16GB version and we all people wont use a phone for more than a year or 2.
only one problem in the phone there is two sim slots but second sim slot is not working   if u use the memory card then it access   this phone is usually used for one sim.
It s specified that it has dual 4G SIM slot but only slot one is 4G compatible and it is not hot swapable.

Nice phone for the price   it got hung to twice when I received a call during music playbackThe phone is good but only one problem is faced that if you use dual sim mode you cannot use micro sdBest mobile at a price of 10000Amazon.
Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.
camera quality average  Network issue for BSNL sim card  contact save option only in mi account and google not in phone memoryOver all good handset  camera quality not as 16megapixel bit heating issue  hybrid slot u can use either second sim or SD cardNo other phone can be compared to RN3 with in this price segment and featuresIf any one think its not good den jus gth.

Good phone i am using it for last seven days there is no problem at all phone running very well no lag no heating problem while heavy gaming but i think that 3GB model will be better choice because if you install lots of apps or games than more than 90  ram will use that may cause phone lagging or other problem.

or one sim  -2
Then removed the second sim and it worked fineOther features are excellent  but for this one.
one sim is nano sim  one sim is small sim  you may have to sacrifice one sim if you want to use a memory card for expansion.
Its a dual sim card phone.
only one problem in the phone there is two sim slots but second sim slot is not working   if u use the memory card then it access   this phone is usually used for one sim.
An issue with inserting dual sim and memory card and the phone heated up with a longer use.
so purchasing 32 gb variant is a good idea for dual sim usersMain problem of this phone is .
Disadvantage is we cant use  2 Sim with Memory card on sametimeExecellent work done by u.
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
Very bad product camera quality is very bad and not support dual sim with micro SD cardBest phone in 10000 range ths phone performance is superb camera quality greatnd screenSpecifications claim like full HD and 16mp camera  is far below the standard in redimi note 3.
6. sometimes youtube video takes to start from the beging while amid of watching those and that gets resolved when i try changing the volume using volume button  7. sim card port total two ports  one is solely sturcturized for nano sim another can be either used for sd card or can b used for another sim that is highly disadvantagous who wants to keep two sim as well as the sd card so i chose sims over sd card and now my sd card is of no use  The phone is a mark of beauty.
After receiving on 23rd May 2016 today is 8th of June 2016 I am not been able to do anything with this mobile not getting my money back to purchase the other model of this and use the new 4g sim which is lost almost its data pack.

One more thing you can use any one of them second SIM   Memory Card in this phone.
It s specified that it has dual 4G SIM slot but only slot one is 4G compatible and it is not hot swapable.
so that one can use dual sim as well as memory cardPreviously we had redmi 2 it was working well.
But 16gb is very less And also the phone has hybrid dual sim to put sd card hence 16gb is very very less if you put have sim to insert.

Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.

One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
either two sim at one time or one sim with micro sd card.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
Hi friends   any one who wants dual sim along with sd card don t buy this mobile  this is.
Since I had to cut one Micro Sim to Nano sim  I am now not able to use it on the older phone also.

Nice phone for the price   it got hung to twice when I received a call during music playbackThe phone is good but only one problem is faced that if you use dual sim mode you cannot use micro sdBest mobile at a price of 10000Amazon.
If your budget is no a constraint  then opt for the 32 GB version if you are lucky to get one  otherwise the 16 GB works fine with a 32 GB card put instead of a second sim.
Then whats the meaning of dual sim f. phone.
Please do not buy if you are looking dual sim with sd support same time it doesn t work in this phone.
The phone ki very good in condition awesome mobile looks like iPhone 6s plus mobileSir hum isko kaise purchase kare buy now add to cart ka option hi nahi aa rha ismeOne major drawback is that we can use second sim or memory card any one at a timeNice phone in this price range ho gold colour is much better than grey   silver.

sim with memory  -2
Its describe that it is dual sim with expendable memory.
not working with dual sim and no memory expandable.
this phone not a dual sim is a singal sim because same time memory card   sim 2 both eligible are not use in same   battery is not removable   other earphone is not working this deviceNice phone with great features and specifications.
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
Either we can use dual sim or single sim with micro SD memory card.
Look of the mobile  Battery life  but i dont game  use internet at intervals Disliked   no memory card support with dual sim  hybrid sim card slot   5.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
Because of not supporting dual sim along with external memory.

Can t use memory card along with duel sim.
dual sim with memory are not available for use.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.

Worse still  Amazon is not accepting request for replacement and are asking me to send a mail or talk to Mi Service.
Not happy with Amazon return policyNot Happy with over all performance ofMi Note 3 16Gb MobileHang S alotHeating issueFinger print not works all timeAwesome phoneRedmi note 3 gives a premium and good in looks.

apps  -2
major problem is heating when charging and while using other heavy apps.
thts very irritating while u using apps such as Avast battery saver  Greenfy  Clean master.
While playing games this phone do not lags but sometimes while using Snapchat insta and other apps it lags too much but very less  no.
2gb variant sometimes lag while going back to home when using heavy apps .
its gonna sell 32 gb ones too  mobile is superr  but internal storage is very low because of internal apps and 2nd sim SD card is same slat  that the main problem when 2 sims used its not adjustable  storage i want 32 GB internal memoryThe first one I buy had problem with its headphone connection.
Please Dont Buy this Phone  It have a lots of problem within two days it started hanging when i m using two Apps Parallel and over Heating Issue so i replaced the Item .
Even with updates it s start keeping apps in memory also.
One can hide folders in the gallery or even set a child lock to limit the visibility to certain apps.
If u want performance for productive apps then go this one.
MIUI is very customizable and also includes much essential apps for backup  virus scanner  clean master  etc.
Camera quality is so badMany apps crash while using regularlyDisplay glass should be gorilla glassAnd phone is heating while chargingI Got the product today.
most precious installed apps can be removed .
I like this phone  I waited for a while to buy this phone  Everything is quite good except that it has a heating problem  After a month of purchase  the phone started to hang frequently especially while using apps such as instagram.
many important apps are auto closing.
Without installing any external apps or setup gmail accounts which needs sync  it shows 900 MB ram free.
it lags to show home screen when multiple apps are open.

As a final verdict I will suggest go ahead and buy u will not be regrated.
but its UI is excellent plus cloud make it worthyHey guys this is pankaj   here i m going to give u my final verdict about Redmi Note 3 16gb  after using it almost 10 days Let s start with Con s first.
--------------------------------------------------------
memory card slot  -2
Common slot of sim and Memory card2.
but i havent got any answers yetSecond sim and memory card slot is same which was not mentioned in item description.
SIM CARD SLOT  It supports dual sim card but if u put external memory card you cannot insert 2nd sim it is the biggest disadvantage of this phone.
Product is good  if it is having seperate  slot for memory card  removable battery option  sim insert slot is  still best phonei received faulty unit  with no volumes coming from speaker  so i had to return and im awaiting for the refund since last monthGuys  this seller sends item without quality check.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
One hybrid memory card slot is there which is interchangeable with 2nd sim card no extra memory card slot is there.
LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
It s an awesome phone and hv a premium  look camera is OK battery is good  only problem is memory and sim  slot Dere is only two slots either  u can put memory card or sim.
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
but 2nd sim and memory card have single slot so that you can use eigther 2nd sim or memory card.
I didnot check sim2 and used memory card in second slot which also worked fine.
i like itVery goodExcellentExcellentTooo goodGood VerySatisfiedExcellentExcellentvery niceVary disappointed for 32gb variantI have got this product today but  not satisfied due to less space as committed by its ads and if u are using duel sim than u don t have any space for  insurt the memory card in same slot.
--------------------------------------------------------
32 gb variant  2
RAM is 2 GB whereas in the 32 GB variant RAM is 3GB.
But this 2gb variant is not ment for d power users.
The 3GB 32GB variant available only in gold color.
I have ordered new gold 16gb mobile because there is no 32 gb variant available.
When is 32 GB variant if note 3 launchingNiceBut memory slot is big problemgoodGoodawsmgoodlikeNiceUltimate Performance.
seriously it is very bad you are not letting us purchase the 32 gb variant.
xiaomi not able to manufacture 3Gb variant.
available 3GB  variant on every sale.
making us wait for so  much time n den putting up only one variant is not at all good  when there r two variants  then they should be for sale.
Good but was waiting for 3 32gb variant.
BUILD QUALITY Probably the best  if not the best  The phone feels premium in the hand and certainly looks costlier than it actually is  especially the golden variant i think DISPLAY I was a little unhappy with the display at first but then i realized there was a protective layer on the SCR n which i had nt taken off  Once i did that  I was pleasantly surprised  great saturation of colours  great colour accuracy.
On the other side Letv1s is doing good and will be happy if amazon xiaomi not launched 32 Gb variant soon.
--------------------------------------------------------
awesome  -2
Sound  quality is goodNo hands free with boxCant remove batteryEverything is just awesome camera  performance and quality of the mobile just awesome.
Awesome phoneAlpesh VariyaAvarage phone32 gb i  wantBest in classNice Phone  Truly amazingSupperb phoneIts very goodGood  phone.
got it finally definitely nt fake sale  P  all u need is better internetIt s awesome  mobile.
Awesome mble nice battery backup but charger heat while charging  about camera its awesome and front camera is also cool fingerprint sensor is best ever little bit bqttery drain while heavy gamingThe camera is not at all good.
--------------------------------------------------------
sim and memory  2
this phone not a dual sim is a singal sim because same time memory card   sim 2 both eligible are not use in same   battery is not removable   other earphone is not working this deviceNice phone with great features and specifications.
An issue with inserting dual sim and memory card and the phone heated up with a longer use.
And now in turn to use memory card I have to close second sim .
Found the battery capacity to be the best feature of this phone  or else feel duped as find that cannot have both second sim and external memory card as advertised.
I didnot check sim2 and used memory card in second slot which also worked fine.
camera quality average  Network issue for BSNL sim card  contact save option only in mi account and google not in phone memoryOver all good handset  camera quality not as 16megapixel bit heating issue  hybrid slot u can use either second sim or SD cardNo other phone can be compared to RN3 with in this price segment and featuresIf any one think its not good den jus gth.
we cannot insert both dual sim and a memory card in same time.
Worth for each pennyPhone is good but internal memory 6gb eated by software and sim slot is same for memory card.
Major Review I have to give is this the phone is having dual sim and supports memory card but u can do only one thing either u can activate or run dual sim same time or 1 sim and a memory card.
Its really shocked to see that the hand set can t be operate dual sim if want to use memory card.
Hybird Slot   If you are using two sim and required memory for you is more then 10 gb than that is a problem for you.
rest all is bestExpandable memory is nil when second sim is used.
The best phone of xiaomiHappyAnd thanks for amazonVery HappyI simply love it because it packs very nice hardware and plus it is affordableOnly two drawbacks i noticed that u can use only one sim with memory card no separate memory card slot no option for dual sim memory card  battery is non.
its tooo good dudeCan we use dual sim   memory card same timeVery disappointed heat while charging or surfing and watching movies battery backup is not good5 STARS for the product and 5 STARS for Amazon delivery service.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
grey n silver are betterMobile having 1slot for both external memory and nano sim.
If you are using one sim card and one external memory card phone will be a single sim phone otherwise without memory card you can use dual sim card.
They have mention dual sim and expandable memory means external memory card  but out of these three only two can be in at a time.
i thought have good and enough memory but i can t increase memory with dual simIt s a little big for normal hands  also getting metallic finish  gets a bit slippery.
Excellent productYou cant insert dual sim if you want to increase memory b coz you can insert dual sim micro and mini both  or one sim and memry card at one time.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .
Worth For MoneyXiaomi Redmi Note 3 is excellent phone   this price   as company claims it s DUAL SIM it s not   IF we use external Memory card  storage  as this handset  phone  uses SIM 2 SLOT for external storage   SO if we want to use external storage   micro memory card  we can t use SIM 2   if we sue SIM 2 FOR voice or data   than we can t use  external storage .
not working with dual sim and no memory expandable.
Dual SIM function or One Sim and One memory card.
What redmi note 3 provides you is if your 32 gb memory is full and you want to expand memory using micro sd card  you have to remove 2nd sim  Why  Why companis take such stupid decisions  You have full space to provide a separate micro sd slot then why you force the users to compromise with the resources  Seriously its pathetic.
And sim card memory card changing or replacing system is quite difficult.

user  2
for normal user its the best.
This Phone Worths The Every Penny You Spend On iti got the 16 gb variant   i was not able to get 32gbThough 16gb is not a problem  but 2g ram is a little bit problem  as the phone has only about 800 mb ram free to use  still it is sufficient if you are not a very heavy useradvantages  its huge monsterous 4050mah battery which can easily last for a full day after heavy usageits display which produces very crispy and sharp colours  video  photo and all other things looks good on phone   viewing angles are good toofinger print sensor works amazingly  its very responsivemi ui is one of the best ui  you have so many customizations in your phone which makes the phone really coolits dual sim  so you can have two sims in the phonedisadvantages  2 gb ram is not enough if you are a heavy user   phone can lag a bit  but if you are a normal user then ram is not a problem at allabout camera  camera clicks decent pics  both back and front cam takes decent pics in good light  its above averageheating issues  i have not find any heating issues so far  i played several games  but the phone did not get hot very much .
Can t ask for more at this price  Purchased 3 phones in total for my family camera quialty not goodinternal memory not good for user so low total 11.
I am a rough user of phones.
it is commendable backup for daily user  best feature is fingerprint sensor opens phone in 3 sec.
As reviewed by one other user there was  Made in India .
As i said i am a hard gaming user and a rough user so if u install large games and no.
I m bit hard user of mbl so even for me its last for one full day.
Available memory is 11 gb not 16 gb  and user available is around 9.
The volume rockers and the power button are present on the right hand side of the phone and the power button is placed below the volume keys near the middle part of the device therefore making it easy for the user to lock or unlock the handset.
I am a heavy user.
No proper user guide in the package.
I strongly don t recommend to you this phone if you are a heavy user and game lover.
Prssesor is fast 5 5  but heating issued  for heavy user Ram management is poor 3 5   only 950 mb in first boot Display 5 5Touch 5 5Both sims support 4g but in second you use either sim or memory card.
I like big screen and cool camera features   both are available in this phone and i like most in this is its design   sooo nice My First review on Redmiused it for a day only  looks are stunning  it will definitely beat any expensive phone  Sound quality Good  picture quality good  camera performance is good in day light  low light performance is average  but still it can be used  battery back up is good i have used it as a daily user only for surfing  phone calls  whatsapp  some pictures clicking  full day connected to wifi  battery drained 25   from morning 10 am to 8pm after full charge.
Absolutely no lag and a wonderful user interfaceI just want to say in a single word no stories that is overall Very NiceNice Phone but please upgrade your delivery service with your partner  Nice but it is much better if handsfree earphone is included in the box.
4050mah is quite enough for heavy user to last full day2.
I am a regular heavy user but I do not play any graphically intensive Games and have not had any heating at all.
--------------------------------------------------------
waste of money  -2
Seriously pissed off with MIWorst i never like the mobile my money is wastesuperthe phone works fab.
My sincere advise dont go for this mobile waste of money.
--------------------------------------------------------
days of use  2
Really awesome Product I use dis 3 days overall very good budget phoneTotally disgusting guys don t go for they offering worse service and the Mobile is also so extra ordinary rather go for letv le 1s which is 1000 more but satisfactory using cheap tactics of flash sell Also delivery is not on timeBest phone everGood experienceVery nice phoneValue for moneyHeating ProblemFantastic phoneValue for moneyGood experienceQuality ProductBest Phone Till Now from my side.
may be hv sum bugs and fon restarts  happened twice with me in 2 days Overall ds fon is excellent  hope some of bugs will be fixed soon  Fake people   I doubt they have the product because they refused the product all by themself saying that I asked them to refuse the productI ordered redmi note 3 phone in the flash sale.
Good phone i am using it for last seven days there is no problem at all phone running very well no lag no heating problem while heavy gaming but i think that 3GB model will be better choice because if you install lots of apps or games than more than 90  ram will use that may cause phone lagging or other problem.
After 10 days of use I totally disappointed with this phone .
It use to work when i got the phone but after 10 days of usage it just stopped recognizing.
After few days of use  you will find how much you have been cheated.
--------------------------------------------------------
good in day  -2
This Phone Worths The Every Penny You Spend On iti got the 16 gb variant   i was not able to get 32gbThough 16gb is not a problem  but 2g ram is a little bit problem  as the phone has only about 800 mb ram free to use  still it is sufficient if you are not a very heavy useradvantages  its huge monsterous 4050mah battery which can easily last for a full day after heavy usageits display which produces very crispy and sharp colours  video  photo and all other things looks good on phone   viewing angles are good toofinger print sensor works amazingly  its very responsivemi ui is one of the best ui  you have so many customizations in your phone which makes the phone really coolits dual sim  so you can have two sims in the phonedisadvantages  2 gb ram is not enough if you are a heavy user   phone can lag a bit  but if you are a normal user then ram is not a problem at allabout camera  camera clicks decent pics  both back and front cam takes decent pics in good light  its above averageheating issues  i have not find any heating issues so far  i played several games  but the phone did not get hot very much .
Even after lots of search and troubleshooting  i am not able to configure the Finger touch sensorBest mobile for gaming and camera is quite good for the price point battery around 2 days from normal usage high usage 1 day awesome build qualityPhone is good in its appearance otherwise it has worst camera quality in MI phone ever have  occasionally hang  over heat  fingerprint sensor failed.
Front camara OK. Rear camera it is good in day light.
It is more than good in day light  when it comes to low light photography even the 30k or 40k worth smartphone cameras delivers an average class of photo.
Camera was good in day  little disappointed in dark.
I like big screen and cool camera features   both are available in this phone and i like most in this is its design   sooo nice My First review on Redmiused it for a day only  looks are stunning  it will definitely beat any expensive phone  Sound quality Good  picture quality good  camera performance is good in day light  low light performance is average  but still it can be used  battery back up is good i have used it as a daily user only for surfing  phone calls  whatsapp  some pictures clicking  full day connected to wifi  battery drained 25   from morning 10 am to 8pm after full charge.
Fone is not good  it s heating on general use from very first day   it has hanging problem  and not picking signals.
--------------------------------------------------------
u can use  1
Don t by this phone it can be used as heater while charging internet problem battery performance is not as expectedEvery thing is fine except Sim slots means either u use dual Sim or one Sim with memory card and u don t get ear phones.
No return n cant use.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .
The phone was amazing but its front camera I don t understand y is blurrr and IMO is not connecting camera any one nows so plzz tell me ane U can use both sim but no memory and alot one is damage my simXiaomi note 3 is so sleek looking.

you can t evaluate phone like electronic products with in ten days so don t buy any Redmi products It is my own experience  Think before you buy how hard we are work to earn money They creating artificial requirment to market this products by flash sale  so don t buy this Redmi note 3To all those complaing about heating problem while charging.
--------------------------------------------------------
2 gb ram  1
RAM is 2 GB whereas in the 32 GB variant RAM is 3GB.
Most important the internal storage is only 9GB in 16GB and RAM is less than 900MB in 2GB very disappointed by this.
Though this phone comes with Snapdragon processor and 2 gbs of ram  its very disappointing to say its not up to its mark.
LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
big screen size 2 GB ram is nice.
2 GB RAM is available.
Very nice  but 32 GB ver is bettergaram ho rha h want to replace disSpeker sound quality is very poor.
Available RAM in this model is only 750 850 MB out of 2GB  in normal condition without additional apps installation.
7. out of 2gb ram only 1gb free.
6  The 2GB RAM seems adequate for regular use and have not had any stutters at all.
I would have preferred the 32 GB version with 3 GB RAM  but was not lucky to click it in time  as they sold in a couple of seconds.
in the 16gb variant  almost 6 gb is taken by os specially having MIUIgo for 32gb 3gb ram if heavy storage requiredGiving in this price range it is not satisfying  lagging a lot during hd video playback  camera quality is not as expected as 16mp  front camera is good enough  battery backup and screen quality is good  RAM management is very poor it gives you only 50  of the RAM and the remaing is consumed by its internal applications the only best thing i found in this handset is only the fingerprint scanner and nothing else.
bt  now itz showing 2GB ram n 16 GB romWithin one month of its purchase the charging port got spoiled  we took it to claim the mfg warranty  it is now 10days  they are claiming that it might take another 10 days.
currently available 16gb and 2gb ram.
i hd order today of 2gb ram  gray clour   it is sucessfully ordered but i need 2gb ya3gb ram golden so any one exchange with 2GB to 3GB Ram golden   plz contact me  9527785182   bhola16011996 gmail.
in 2gb version ram is usable less than 950mb.
Most of the people asking for 32 GB version with 3 GB Ram but i am lucky to have one in first sale only.
and around 950 mb ram is free out of 2gb.
--------------------------------------------------------
10 days  -1
Really awesome Product I use dis 3 days overall very good budget phoneTotally disgusting guys don t go for they offering worse service and the Mobile is also so extra ordinary rather go for letv le 1s which is 1000 more but satisfactory using cheap tactics of flash sell Also delivery is not on timeBest phone everGood experienceVery nice phoneValue for moneyHeating ProblemFantastic phoneValue for moneyGood experienceQuality ProductBest Phone Till Now from my side.
I have used this phone for hardly 10 days even before its failed.
The best you can get at 10k it is totally awesome using it for last 3 days.
I have been using this from the last 10 days.
They said money will be refunded in 10 working days.
they r not selling their mobile phonesI got it one mobile before 2 days internal storage only 10 GB and heavy heating problem.
It use to work when i got the phone but after 10 days of usage it just stopped recognizing.
I have been using this phone for the past 10 days and here are my observations.
--------------------------------------------------------
3 32 gb  -1
Thanks xiaomi for such a near perfect product  Hello Sir Maine apna mobile 20 may 2016 ko return kiya hai aaj 3din ho gaye hai mera mobile abhi tak nahi aaya hai mane 16 GB ke badle 32 GB ka phone mangwaya hai please sir meri baat par gaur Kate.
I would suggest you to go for 32 GB if available.
Tried from first sale  but not got till now and 32 gb not available now  don t go for 16 gb .
its gonna sell 32 gb ones too  mobile is superr  but internal storage is very low because of internal apps and 2nd sim SD card is same slat  that the main problem when 2 sims used its not adjustable  storage i want 32 GB internal memoryThe first one I buy had problem with its headphone connection.
Overall go for 32 gb phone instead of the 16 gb otherwise you will have storage problem  9999 rs me ye best me sabase best mobile hai.
Very nice  but 32 GB ver is bettergaram ho rha h want to replace disSpeker sound quality is very poor.
I was interested in buying 32 GB GOLD 3 GB  but I bought this because of non availability of 32 gb device.
they are worried abt 16 gb phones which may not b brought by customers  us   as soon as the 32 gb comes in the market.
seriously it is very bad you are not letting us purchase the 32 gb variant.
RAM is 2 GB whereas in the 32 GB variant RAM is 3GB.
The 32 GB would have been the ultimate  but I m happy with 16GB.
Good But its Taking too Much Memory taking 5 GB internally to run  I think its too much  Better to Go for 32 GB versionI think mi note 3 mobile is very good mobile under 10000camera.
On the other side Letv1s is doing good and will be happy if amazon xiaomi not launched 32 Gb variant soon.
--------------------------------------------------------
want to use  -1
Display is full HDIf u want to buy this mobile just rember one thing camera is average and charger which comes worh mobile if u use ur mobile heats up Don t buy this productThe mobile is hang and switch off  suddenlyDoes not work properlyJust because it is so hard to buy dis phone  i am a big fan of xiomi but not of there selling strategy  and looking at the demand of this phone it is really a pain in the a. to buy this phone specially a 3 gb RAM version.
--------------------------------------------------------
in flash sale  1
Looks a used one  thinking this is a returned piece from earlier sale .
redmi note 3 is biggest joke in flash sale historyYesWawyesworst product  mother board is gone for only for 20days.
The flash sale is very bad but its practical because this model launched in India almost along with Chinese release.
It s the problem and no other problem with this phoneI got this phone in the first flash sale and I have been using this phone for more than 10 days  This is an awesome phone even if it is not  10k.
WiFi not workingI am trying to buy this phone but the sale is fake I am clicking on add to cart it doesnt respondDon t buy this mobile bcoz camera s bad results and also storage problem if you buy 16gb varients.
Those guys who can t buy ii nn a flash sale as the sale the phone gets out of stock within a sec just download flash sale helper from Google play store or download it from Google chrom extension.
5 10  RATINGthe phone is looking very good but i am expecting the flash sale for 3 gb   32 gb on 30.
if u make open sale for one month with lakhs for products and also Xiaomi Service is VERY BADGot the phone yesterday.
Got the Redmi Note 3 in the third flash sale  had to settle for the 16 gig variant.
dont waste moneyGood Devicegreat phonei like thisXiaomi devices are just orcemBettar to choose this apple of chinaJaluddinNice phoneOsam phonevery excite buy this phoneProblem of call quality very very poor  why i am improve call qualitya big thumb down for the fake flash sale.
fake sale  why they are not selling 32 gb variant.
basically no point in flash sale if u don t wana sell.
Thumbs down for the flash sale thoughVery nice this mobileJust started to use.
Superb phoneGood productMind blowingIts a cheating sale.
This is what happens when we go for flash sale.
And  a request to reviewers  when you are rating the product one or two stars  based on whether or not you could acquire one during the flash sale  you re hampering the reputation of the company and it s potential to deliver better so kindly abstain from that and show a bit of patience.
Note 3 bought on flash sale .
Waiting 4 Next sale 4 32gb  good phone with fast processor.
got it finally definitely nt fake sale  P  all u need is better internetIt s awesome  mobile.
I think Lenovo K4  Is better Thn Redmi Note 3Today I received my phone nice loook   nice feature this is my first mi phone Excellent experience of flash sale today.
so please do open sale.
When I heard  about launch of Red mi note 3 I was pretty excited to get the one with 32 GB memory but unfortunately didn t got success in any flash sale for almost one month after launch.
Yallow flash light its very badNot at all good  heats like he ll.
Got the phone from the last sale  but was shocked when it recognised only one sim card.
U just earned lot of frustrated customers through this flash sale funda.
fake and artificial flash sale of redmi note 3  32GB  variant.
An unsuccessful attempt at the flash sale doesn t make Redmi Note 3 a bad phone  as a matter of fact it is offering the best features within this price range.
I am a user of MI from last one year when I bought Redmi note 4G in flash sale last year.
5. camera flash is not good.
Dual tone flash is true and good.
The device should sell either in good number or it should sell in open sale like other phones.
Waited for 32gb since first flash sale  but MI cheated us not managing enough stock.
On last flash sale I was not able to check out coz of internal error pop.
Despite the awful flash sale experience  I love the device.
I thought to purchase white colour  but it is not available  in flash sale   compare to white colour  gold colour  looks stylish really awesome.
Sheer luck that I was able to get a hold of it at the first flash sale itself.
Xiaomi should think to provide seperate slot for memory card so that both slot can be used for SIMStill selling in flash sale.
Dont buy this product at allVery very poor camera quality and 2 nd slot can only use either of 2nd sim or memory card which is cheating to the customerI have bought this product in flash sale where in I had an option of buying other productsAmazon also should also care for the customers and there are no customer reviews being shown for the product before purchase of the productPhones camera is disappointing.
Stop the flash sale.
Dual color LED flash is great but it might over saturate colors of the subject when using flash.
of 32GB variants in flash sale.
I m glad to got an opportunity to buy this one so early in context of reviews about mobile I think it s too early to judge though I m satisfied and happyworst flash sale ever .
flash sale.
up coming bt today s sale I got what I want great I got it.
But the flash sale system is really poor.
Cheap Marketing  trying since last 5 flash sale to get 32GB model  but no luck.
And a main drawback I felt was the hybrid sim card slot where its a difficult choice between 2nd Sim   SD Card  Due to Flash sale I could get my hands on the 16 GB one only as I need the phone urgently   couldn t wait up for the next flash sale .
crappy phone it heats more than iron box so this people leave flash sale to create out of stock not at all worth for phoneYupp.
Pathetic Flash Sales.
Jio sim volte not properly work don t try this mobile sale sab fack haWhy.
just be fast in flash sale and keep on waiting in waiting list.
I got the 32 GB with 3 GB of Ram in the very first sale on 9 th March it self.
camera quality is not as per specificationI have ordered the phone on flash sale and Amazon delivered it in 3 days .
bought it on 30th march on flash sale from Amazon.
8 10  Great pictures in day light but not in night  it would be good if there could be front flash too.
My father got frustrated too and ultimately he gave me another 11k and insisted to buy one plus 2 it s  a big lolz on xiaomi actually its not worth one star too but that is for awesome specs which well you can t buy thanks to one plus and xiaomi try quitting this flash sale system as one plus did with its invite system you lost one fan I hope you take care of others.
you can t evaluate phone like electronic products with in ten days so don t buy any Redmi products It is my own experience  Think before you buy how hard we are work to earn money They creating artificial requirment to market this products by flash sale  so don t buy this Redmi note 3To all those complaing about heating problem while charging.
i jst hope in the upcoming flash sale.
may be hv sum bugs and fon restarts  happened twice with me in 2 days Overall ds fon is excellent  hope some of bugs will be fixed soon  Fake people   I doubt they have the product because they refused the product all by themself saying that I asked them to refuse the productI ordered redmi note 3 phone in the flash sale.
Dual flash yellow in colour.
Tried from first sale  but not got till now and 32 gb not available now  don t go for 16 gb .
I purchased itin the flash sale that took place on the 30.
NiceGoodgoodGoodThey dont wanna sell the phones im trying for last every sale im nt able to buy itWhat is d point in saleRear camera is too bad .
Firstly  one had to wait till June 01 for the open sale   now they have not put up the 3GB RAM 32 GB model for sale.
I have got the dark grey 16gb variant on 2 nd flash sale.
still decent photo can be taken with flash it s good.
Luckily  I got this phone in first flash sale and it was delivered to my place in just 19 hours.
This  Redmi Note 3  promises to be better  Thanks Mi  Great phone under this price  exelent performanceBut it could be might better in Camer with Sony Samsung technology and with Gorilla GlassI got Redmi Note 3 in first sale.
Camera quality is very low  dont buy frinds mi create flash sale it is new technic to seeling is product Ii feel sad to buy this dont buy this phoneCamera quality is poor camera app needs some changeFinger print sensor is awesomeIt doesn t even need one rating zero is betterNot even one star.
So go ahead and grab it  So  I registered for the sale of this phone and booked it on the flash sale of 20th.
Want to give ZERO star for this flash sale.
and then I tried keeping registering every time in flash sale.
But the thing is that xiaomi is selling their phone in every Wednesday and flash sale basis so some people are having trouble.
I cant wait anymore just a last try in the next sale after that i gona buy a diffrent phone and xiomi u will lose one of ur loyal customer.
good lookI got this phone on 23 march sale.
Never buy   Bad Camera  2nd sim slot    memory card issuePhone is superb but amazon product packing is very poorFake Sale.
Hi I registered this phone for first sale on 9 the march unfortunately I didn t able to purchase but got it from mi store.
this flash sale gives really bad message about amazonSuperb Mobile Not even found any single problem or default I read many reviews about heating problems but I din face this problem.
the flash sale was not annoying at all .
Its the height of stupidity by Amazon of creating a fake flash sale.
amazon is very fast delivery i like this so much mi note 3 aswome  rocking but thing is battary is not removabal so badWorst flash sale ever.
but no flash sale here.
Some time hanging problem and call issuesThe phone everthing is great butif u use dual sim then u can t  use memory card or if u use memory card then u can use only single simits mean if u use  dual sim u have no option to use memory card  Only 9 GB spaceBought it in flash sale .
One of the best phone at this price rangeMany people are not able to purchase through flash sale in amazon  So try to purchase in MI Web site which I purchased another phone through there website today.
Very good phone in all aspects except that pictures with Flash are not coming good.
Xiaomi making fools the people by advertising and flash sale through Amazon.
amazon service is 3 starsBought the phone in the first flash sale on 9 March 2016.
I have purchased this mobile in first sale.
verry verry good mobiledefinately a fake sale.
battery OK. Its amazon trick its in flash sale.
I purchased mobile from MI website during flash sale on 6 April 2016.
Xiaomi artificially creating boom   insulting Indian customers valuefake flash sale.
Well I ve been trying to get xiaomi redmi note 3 since 16th March waited for all sales like a fool so frustrated with this useless flash sales and most awesome thing happened.
Front camera is good for selfi again you may need light as there is no front flash but in this price range it is the bestthe camera quality is very poor even it does not stands with my lg l90s 8mp camera even in day light the pics are blurred.
but also painful trying every sale since it is too dificult better make the sale open or close the sale until you get enough items to keep it openIt stopped working 2 days after the return period ended.
I bought it from mi store as amazon don t ship to my area and its flash sale are a headache but worth buying it.
and even the last sale was fake.
Also  units of note 3 offered for sale is too low because it got over in less than 1 second in last 2 sales.
I did not get the phone after 3 failed flash sale.
Most of the people asking for 32 GB version with 3 GB Ram but i am lucky to have one in first sale only.

sim ports are goodIn online mention 16 GB internal memory but I l be in get only 11 GB cellphone why its I l not under standProduct is OK forSpeed and an allThe best phone under 10k u can have.
not happy with the product9 GB available of 16 .
and one more problem is there here this 16 GB internal storage and one sim card and one memory card otherwise no memory card only two sim cards im very sad after purchasing this phoneValue for money productDumfries TV kalsu inkedIts hot while charging.
delivery is in timeproduct sold with 16 GB internal memory but in actual it has only 10 GB and also not work during charging.
Tried from first sale  but not got till now and 32 gb not available now  don t go for 16 gb .
LTEMobile is too good looking wise as well as functionally wilse but there is a problem at the time of Charging its Heat so much   another one there is no slot for memory card and exist memory i. e. 16 GB usable only 10 GB and RAM out of 2 GB only 900 MB is usable.
56 GB is available and I also brought 16gb varient and only 10.
good16 GB is not worth taking for those who loves to store music and all .
These geniuses don t know 1GB 1024MB and think manufacturers are cheating customer buy giving only 9 GB free in a 16 GB phone.
I felt cheated when Phone shows 11 GB internal memory only 9 GB can be used  as opposed to the claimed 16 GB storage.
they are worried abt 16 gb phones which may not b brought by customers  us   as soon as the 32 gb comes in the market.
bt  now itz showing 2GB ram n 16 GB romWithin one month of its purchase the charging port got spoiled  we took it to claim the mfg warranty  it is now 10days  they are claiming that it might take another 10 days.
This is very bad for a 16 GB phonePhone heats like a hell while charging.
Overall go for 32 gb phone instead of the 16 gb otherwise you will have storage problem  9999 rs me ye best me sabase best mobile hai.
all over phn is good except these 2 issuesI am using this phone from 1 week and till now I have faced any issues  only draw back which I felt is limitation in using Dual SIM and Extended memory  like I am restricted to use either SIM   SIM or SIM   Memory card  considering 16 GB internal memory one has to go for extended memory but that bargain with SIM 2.
The 32 GB would have been the ultimate  but I m happy with 16GB.
16 GB suffices for data storage for me and 2 GB is fast enough.
3 GB available memory out of 16 GB3.
