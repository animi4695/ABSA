bad performance  -35
I am using this phone now for about 9 months and flawless performance delivered.
I never want to mention about the specs as Flipkart already did it  Flipkart delivered the product in 2 days  When I first booted the phone  as others said  it got heated  But as we use  the phone never gets heated too much except while charging  The display is great  The phone s performance is extraordinary  The MIUI is buttery smooth  No need of extra launchers 
43 degree limits and at the same time Xiaomi has enabled all 8 cores at the same time  earlier only 6 cores were enabled in normal mode to prevent overheating which resulted in lags   stutter and slow performance  but now phone gives better performance with all 8 cores On and almost no lags.
I must say this phone is a pretty cheap phone with below average performance.
It took ages to install Play Store Apps or loading some Performance heavy app such as Quora.
I have not seen any overheating in default mode and am still able to play all the games I want.
 It s is very good performance wise and Camera Quality also too good.
Little bit heating issue which is very common for all the high range processors mobile phones but nothing will get impact about performance  go for it  cheers  
One is the performance mode and the other is balanced mode.
Super performance  except few lags due to new Miui on Lollipop  I am sure it will be fixed in future updates  bcoz I have seen Miui6 on Redmi Note without such lags in balanced mode  And this is 64. bit processor  so once all apps are tuned for 64. bit then phone will rock .
Battery drains out fast  battery saver mode not very efficient 
performance is too good  change the default settings to  performance mode  which will be in  balanced mode  in default to increase the device performance and speed .
Great features  great battery and the performance is great too at this price range.
Overall performance is superb.
handed mode  Switching ON torch during lock mode etc.
Excellent Performance This much of good Camera Result in this price is too good part of it Performance vise its tremendous.
Also for the speakers because I always uses silent mode or vibration mode  
cmaera performance is wowww love this beauty and hate zenfone2 now and good luck no heating problem it is in zenfone so go ahead and buy mi4i 
performance is poor.
Battery performance is very nice and it does give a long standby time  even while gaming the battery drain is not so much as compared to other phones.
If someone is disappointed after such performance in such price then there is no word for me to say  P 
I purchased this mobile from Flipkart and very satisfied with overall performance especially the camera quality.
This doesn t mean that the phone has to be in low performance mode all the time  since the balanced mode works very well and is optimum for regular usage.
looks are good but performance is the worst 
Overall performance is super.
Almost the same performance and screen quality but there are some bugs reported which makes phonecalls dropping voice quality etc This may be rectified soon with some OTA udpate .
Phone freezed  got heated and the overall performance was very sluggish.
I received this device yesterday  and I was very disappointed with the performance.
Lag in overall performance 
Even vibration mode is not effective.
Performance is uber great.
3  Performance is also not very good.
In the balanced mode  it is sluggish and can at times hang on some apps  mine does on Murfie.great performance  75
7 apps simultaneously  on balanced mode .
Everything is great and near perfect but phone heats to extreme even in standby mode and while charging.
Performance is decent considering the price.
In order to get best performance  installed the over 800 Mb update that was indicated in the settings.
43 degree limits and at the same time Xiaomi has enabled all 8 cores at the same time  earlier only 6 cores were enabled in normal mode to prevent overheating which resulted in lags   stutter and slow performance  but now phone gives better performance with all 8 cores On and almost no lags.
The camera is top notch in every way  be it picture quality or other features  It even has a manual mode  The flash works pretty well  giving out the same results that a DSLR would give in low light.
 Performance is really good and the screen very clear and crisp.
Performance  Performance is very good in Performance mode but very slightly glitchy in Balanced mode just sometimes.
Good performance Multitasking  Gaming 
No heating issue and battery performance is very good.
3  Performance  Heating Issue and Software  Performance is good and somewhat better than Yureka.
Coming to performance  I am able to play alphat 8 high end game  with out any lag.
Camera is very nice  beautify mode is superb
guest mode is classic.
It has excellent performance.
Both the cameras will give the best performance at this price segment.
Lollipop is good and performance is also good.
For better battery life  keep the phone in balanced performance mode and 40.
And the last but not the least the performance of this device we all know this device comes with 2 GB RAM and the Octa.
1 which is the latest release and now the UI is smooth as butter even in balanced performance mode.
Performance is good.
 Excellent over all performance   major limit is there is no memory expansion option  only 12.
Performance is nice.
Battery performance is very good.
Performance is great.
MI4I is great in terms of specifications and great performance .
 The phone performance is very nice and good camera but there is a heating problem in this phone.
Ran Asphalt8 for 10 min in balanced mode  didn t face any UI lags  but the device became warm beside the camera  checked the temp .
Although  i haven t tried any high performance games yet  there are no lags or performance failure.
Go ahead for the phone if you are looking for a handy sexy performance mi.
It s awesome when it comes to performance.
 Very good performance.
I am so much impressed by the performance and great display.
High Battery performance n good looking phone.
Antu benchmark scored about 39k in performance mode and about 28k in balanced mode.
Used the phone extensively in balanced mode
The camera and sound performance is great too.
I shifted for a Lenovo K900  a phone which was double the price of this phone and I must say that this phone gives an equal competion or even sometimes better performance than phones of a higher price range.
I played Asphalt 8  Airborne both in balanced and performance mode at normal settings and it played well  No glitches  
The balanced mode takes the life out of this phone.
good performance
Snapdragon processor even in balanced mode and 2GB LPDDR3 makes miui buttery smooth and fluid.
Good performance.
But lags on balanced mode.
Performance is uber great.
Performance lags  I am not talking hifi performance the basic functionality is lagging  
application working and performance are wonderful  and display is very brilliant.
Front camera is awesome with beautify mode.
4. performance Mi4i comes with 2gb ram and 16 gb rom still it offers great performance in multitaskin  videos playback browsing so on .
Overall performance is super.
all specs performance was great.
I am using it for just over a week and I am satisfied with its performance.
Very Good Performance  NO lags till now.
Excellent performance.
4  The gaming performance is extremely smooth.
Phone Heat  Phone heating is very high on performance mode.
I am really very happy to see its performance.
performance is good enough but heats a lot.
Dont try to take pics with manual mode until you know it well.
the battery performance is also good it lasts a day easily 12hrs may be 20 hrs.
Worst Battery ever even in standby mode the battery drains within 8hrs.
performance is very good.
 Good performance
Performance is excellent.
High performance in low price 
This doesn t mean that the phone has to be in low performance mode all the time  since the balanced mode works very well and is optimum for regular usage.
and reading in mobile mode.
But please don t click with manual mode untill you are not so accustomed to click picture in manual mode.
For the price this is easily the best compact 5inch mobile u can buy with acceptable performance  camera and battery life.
mobile performance is also good
Some lags are there while gaming on balanced mode.
In the balanced mode  it is sluggish and can at times hang on some apps  mine does on Murfie.

heating issue  -45
i bought redmi 1s last year it has less heating problem but less than this one  mi4i .
After second update  specially for this overheating issue  now NO ISSUE OF OVERHEATING.
Due to heating issue i will not recommend to buy this as heating device annoys a lot.
But keep mind it its more important then that it has very heavy heating issue  while plug in to charge it was started to heat like a iron box.
I dont face any heating issue.
Yes  the camera part  that s where the motherboard is housed  heats up slightly  and i mean slightly  which is no reason for concern at all.
6  moderate heating issue.
only small heating problem
no such heating issue.
but little heating issues.
At least i am not facing any heating issue.
 This phone has lot of expectation before launching when i purchase this phone i was not happy as heating problem   rates are worth 
With respect to the Heating issue  I have updated to the latest MIUI 6.
Little heating issue in this phone bt aftr update it will resolve.
about the heating issue   i dint experience it till now.
The heating issue is real  especially during call receiving and you can feel on your ears.
Handset touch response is totally poor   Heating issues.
Other than the heating issue  I did not feel any kind of problem in this phone.
Never noticed any heating issue  used camera for long time   it was little warm but it was normal
all people wrote a review that phone has a heating problem but i think all are wrong.
Just go for it you will be very delighted and don t just miss such an unbeatable phone just because of little heating problem 
Mr Hugo Barra says that Mi 4i is for India during the lunching   but such heating issue disappoints me or Indian Mi fans so much  Visual IVR I cant found.
PS  Heating is not a major issue as some people are saying.
Unbearable heating and lagging in performance issue makes the phone worst in available.
Finally i would like to talk about a minor heating issue in the phone.
look awasm but in my phone there is some heating problem it become heavy hot some time at the top section  heavy hot .
So am not facing any heating issue.
Luckily i don t see any heating problem in my device it is just perfect.

OVERALL HEATING ISSUE WITH THIS HANDSET YOU ARE UNABLE TO USE IT WITH IN CHARGING YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR 5.
i bought this mobile on first flash sale and this mobile started heating like anything  please think twice before buying this mobile  MI is cheating the customers by selling this cheap mobile with high SAR value as u know higher the SAR value causes Cancer even i faced lot of problems with in two weeks of time and requested flipkart for replacement and after fighting for 9 days flipkart replaced the mobile thanks to flipkart but after replacement also am facing the same problem with this mobile You cannot speak more than 10 min in this mobile .
its too much un bearable heating issue .
I hv not figured out much heating problem  but still phone heats up sometimes.
ya there is lil bit issue of heating while charging but that no an big issue rest everyting is amazing at this price segment  amazing camers  processor etc.
So if your planning to buy this mobile and no issue of using a mobile which gets heated so much  you can google search you will find lot of reviews of mobile heating   then only go for this mobile else its just a hype dont go there are lot of good mobile and online shopping portals.
And i haven t seen heating issue which is too much.
Full heating issue for any usage   this is after new update   not worth if heating issue is not resolved   and miui also not working some times   
I didnt find any heating issue n all.
15K look no further just buy it  few reviver have reported heating issue  honestly I did not experience heating issue after 2 days of heavy uses  battery capacity is excellent it last more than one and half day.
There is undoubtedly a heating issue in the device  but not as much people are saying.

It s lag free and has no heating issue at all.
Also heating issue is present.

Yesterday there was an update released by Xiaomi which they claim will fix the heating issue  but even though I have installed the update it hasn t fixed my issue.
After second update  specially for this overheating issue  now NO ISSUE OF OVERHEATING.
 Heating of phone during charging is a major problem which all buyer will face with Mi 4i.
Only one minor drawback is the heating issue.
I recognized this has a major issue Heating.

So   NEVER ACTUALLY FELT   the so called heating issue.

 It s good camera is working fine heating issue fine and processing is good  
So far i havent even experienced much talked heating issues.
This phone heats up normally like every other phone  it has no extensive heating issues like every other person has been complaing about in their reviews.
Many now have reported heating issue.
There is a slight heating problem which happens only after more than 30.
Mr Hugo Barra says that Mi 4i is for India during the lunching   but such heating issue disappoints me or Indian Mi fans so much  Visual IVR I cant found.
infact the new one along with the heating issues has various other small issues like light sensors not working  wifi was not working properly.
3. heating issue while charging browsing  at the time of camera using.
I am recived the phone 9th june 2015 for Mi4i  some technical problem  i can t recived the phone bcoz phone is very heating.
Other than the heating issue  I did not feel any kind of problem in this phone.
no heating issue.

There is a little heating issue even after the update  even though they claims that they have fixed it with the recent update  but not to the large extend.
everything else is good but heating is a big issue mi should work on heating problem 
The other biggest issue is heating which I can manage but the display pattern not works may be a fault in the product.
its too much un bearable heating issue .
end features they had given  the heating issue makes the phone feels like a shit on hand.
Best phone in this price  Xiaomi has to fix this heating issue.
1  Heating problem in upper and lower part.
no such heating issue.
Major problem is heating.
Little bit heating issue which is very common for all the high range processors mobile phones but nothing will get impact about performance  go for it  cheers  
--------------------------------------------------------
worst mobile  -23
The users were given replacement devices but some of them faced the same issue with the replaced device as well.
But only thing is you need to be lucky enough to get a quality and defect free device.
0  it hasn t felt any warmer than any other device people are using these days.
I don t want to recommend such type of stupid device.
the mi4i is an exceptional device.
Overall a great device with a great battery and superb processor speeds.
No visibility of where the device was or how long it would really take for delivery was shared.
might the other users got other device mine is PICTURE PERFECT as of launch.
Then they will ask you to get a validation from Mi service center that the device is faulty.
really disappointed from this device.
I installed some games such as asphalt 8   dead trigger 2 played both games the device performed very good with some unnoticeable minute lags of course during this time the device starts heating up with very light increase in temperature.
On 2G it works fine but 2G is bygone now and considering this supports LTE   I dont think this device is ready to handle 4G.
I won t rate it 5 out 5 if I bought this from me because I am gamer and this device can t handle crunch situation but it does a good job for my sis.
18 months of research for this shit is total waste if you make such device 
i got new device with in 4days of request  but fortunately again i got the same speaker issue.
coming to functioning 2nd i found Blue tooth connectivity issue  requested flipkart they have taken replacement request and delivered the new device.
Although you get to see some low specs on paper  but believe me  Motorola is a great brand and it has optimized everything to make such a device which performs way better than this chinese product.
This device is not for worth 13K 
Ran Asphalt8 for 10 min in balanced mode  didn t face any UI lags  but the device became warm beside the camera  checked the temp .
Since they manufacture less no of device so their spare parts availability is also an issue.
P But not at all healthy device.
I hope this device stays good for longer.

as its cpu is on top right behind your small speaker.

low volume in external speaker and headphones is another drawback.

Next talking about the display   yes full hd it is 441ppi excellent display bt in sunlight the sunlight display feature of this phone dosent work very well does help tho.
on videos i throw 720p 1080p full hd videos nd it says it is cool  no lag no distortion at all sound quality amazing  enjoy pc videos at mobile at any angle.
also the battery life was really good with the fact that it has an octacore processor and a full hd display.
DISPLAY the full hd display is surreal its AWESOME 
the 13 MP camera on the phone is something to appreciate as 13MP digital cameras dont perform as much as this and i personally loved the Magic Focus and HDR recording for full HD recording.
I also tested the cameras and recorded a full HD video using the front cam.
The quality of this box is very good on this price with a good full HD display and many more.
The only things that I like about this phone are the camera and it s full HD display.
nice full HD screen 
it is playing full hd videos without any lag.
The feel holding itself pretty good  can use d phone in one hand  no fingerprints on the back Full HD display   camera quality is superb with low and bright glaring light.
Full HD is very good

design  16
For instance  the music and video apps are neatly divided into local and cloud sections  the clock app has a new design which is again divided into alarm  stopwatch  timer and clock  weather app has beautiful data visualisation  the Security app is neatly divided into different sections such as cleaner  data usage  blocklist and so on.
slim and good design

no expandable memory  15
no expandable memory.
 hi had bought this phone from flipkart the phone is good but the disadvantage is in built 16 Gb memory no expandable  No Memory slot   it is inbuilt.
No expandable memory slot  though 16 gb was enof for me but its still annoying and also they give free 5gb in Mi cloud 
No expandable memory.
Inexpandable memory
and no expandable memory
only concern is not expandable memory 
The only issue is non expandable memory slot .
And at the same price tag  you even get expandable memory and water proof features which are something to be considered.
Some heavy gamers may find no extra expandable memory card slot a bit dissapointment but for me  16 GB  its enough as I am not a heavy gamer .
5. no expandable memory.
No expandable memory option  tried lots of OTG thumb drives  but doesn t support all  rear camera is not up to the mark.
Could have provided expandable Memory for such cost   Profiled Phone.
And other concerns like no expandable memory   no headphone available in the kit which is pretty known.
With no expandable memory this is quite an issue.
NO expandable memory  keep this in your mind and you could go for the Moto G2 if you want to carry all your media around.
Lack of expandable Memory slot .
First thing is there is no expandable memory option.
This is totally useless product any one can go with other mobiles like ASUS Zenfone 2 which have same features and expandable memory upto 64 GB.
3. no expandable memory
1 Limited Storage  no expandable memory
2  Not expandable memory.
One con s is no expandable memory.
--------------------------------------------------------
no memory card  14
it really depends upon your preferences budget phone  memory  good camera  good music experience big battery  good screen etc   
The only problem people might face could be the lack of Extendable memory slot which I think may not be an issue if you carry an OTG cable.
I suggest not to buy this product till higher memory and heating issue resolved.
No expansion slot to add a memory card  so beware if you think otherwise.
Memory should have been extensible 
If heating and short memory storage is nt an issue the phone is the best.
no expandable memory.
Felt  16GB internal memory is quite insufficient without a SD card slot but can live with it as there is a USB OTG feature.
U need to understand one thing  this phone is not for power users simply bcoz of 11gb internal memory.
I have bought MI 4i from flipkart  the mobile was not as per expectations and 30 days replacement warranty of WS retail is also fake they refused my request the mobile was costed for Rs 12999 and it does not have external memory slot and internal memory is only 16 GB .
At any given time  even after clearing any running app  more than 1GB of phone s memory remains occupied.
No expandable memory slot  though 16 gb was enof for me but its still annoying and also they give free 5gb in Mi cloud 
But low internal memory 
No expandable memory.
5 GB Memory available after the update.
No expandable memory option  tried lots of OTG thumb drives  but doesn t support all  rear camera is not up to the mark.
45 GB  with NO other apps loaded  since there is no Option for memory card you have to keep a Pendrive with you and transfer your clicked photos via OTG.
This issue need to be resolve due to limited internal memory.
5 gb of memory   fair enough for me 
 Great mobile   speed  slim  light weight but no memory expanded this is draw back 
Overall if memory is not issue for you then go and buy.
only concern is not expandable memory 
The only issue is non expandable memory slot .
1  No external memory card .
I love the UI and design only an issue with memory should be expendable but it s fine for normal use.
So far  this phone has been very impressive and I have no complaints  just a missing external memory card slot  which is not really a big deal .
Camera quality is far better than other 13 mp camera  MIUI is too good and user friendl  drawback are that had only 16gb internal memory and dont have any external memory card slot  also has medium heating issue.
Only downside will be Limited memory option.
Bad part is  it comes with only 16 gb hardly 10 gb usable  internal memory and not possible to expand it and no head set .
And at the same price tag  you even get expandable memory and water proof features which are something to be considered.
Sometimes game is getting slow because of low memory even though 2GB RAM available.
After the first update  the free memory after killings all apps would be around 400mb.
less internal memory.
Phone does t have any external memory card slot which is biggest drawback of this phone because out of 16 Gb of internal memory
Because of this memory gets full so phone gets slow.
5. no expandable memory.
Of course  an external memory card slot would have been a major plus point  but quite frankly 16gb memory is enough.
2  Not expandable memory.
but on board memory is workable for day.
only issue with the mobile is inserting an external memory card option is not there.
Unalbe to view Free or used ram memory.
Could have provided expandable Memory for such cost   Profiled Phone.
happy with 16 g internal without an external memory .
8  no provision for external memory but it has 16 gb internal memory and it is sufficient for me  
And other concerns like no expandable memory   no headphone available in the kit which is pretty known.
I could never exhaust 16 GB in my old phone including internal and external memory.
1 Limited Storage  no expandable memory
Some heavy gamers may find no extra expandable memory card slot a bit dissapointment but for me  16 GB  its enough as I am not a heavy gamer .
With no expandable memory this is quite an issue.
Not able to expand memory   No SD Card Slot .
NO expandable memory  keep this in your mind and you could go for the Moto G2 if you want to carry all your media around.
Limited memory
Lack of expandable Memory slot .
The camera quality is not as much good as 13mp  There is no slot for external memory card hence 12.
no external memory.
First thing is there is no expandable memory option.
This is totally useless product any one can go with other mobiles like ASUS Zenfone 2 which have same features and expandable memory upto 64 GB.
3. no expandable memory
Cons  The only problem I feel is the storage option with available memory of around 10 GB.
The 16gb internal memory although might look big enough space for some normal users like me.
The drawbacks i found is heating issue and missing extendable memory option which can be compromised with this price range and quality of the product.
16 gb internal memory is very less keeping todays needs in mind.
and no expandable memory
I had low memory issues with my previous phone only because of excessive and unwanted photos and music in my phone.
One con s is no expandable memory.
I got a third update  one day before writing this review  and after that the free memory goes up to 700mb.
The memory available is only around 12 GB.
Low memory no expandability
--------------------------------------------------------
looks  14
Looks are awesome  The device is sturdy.
compact  thin  looks decent.
looks beautiful
GREAT LOOKS.
For the time being the phone looks and amazing and the feel is just nonparallel.
First I was surprised with the build quality with outstanding looks and also got attracted to it s sleeky design.
Still images looks good but when clicked against moving objects it takes pathetic pictures.
Good looks and design.
Built is good  slim  average looks   
I just fell in love with the looks of the mobile its so light and slim super sexy i loved it.
nice looks
  Very Light weight and slim with premium looks.
looks are good but performance is the worst 
It s build from high quality polycarbonate which gives very premium looks like iphone 5s.
The overall looks and feel of the phone is excellent.
6  very elegant looks .
Looks stilish.
 This is extremely buggy   Gave 2 stars for overall looks  
looks and feel very good.
I have purchased this mobile on june12  looks wise its nice and impressed.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad quality  -13
Overall Build quality is good
Sound quality is also good  not great  but call clarity is EXCELLENT.
else   you should look for other options like Motorola or ASUS in my testing I found ASUS performing faster that Mi4i and with equally good display and call quality.
3. overall build and quality.
but the biggest grouse is the sound quality n the pathetic volume u might be sitting in the same room and u would still miss calls coz u just cant hear this thing ring and if u prefer listening to music on this phone forget it .
Coming to the build quality its bad as after 20 days my front camera stopped working.
Was a little doubtful about the build and quality of the cell to buy without prior reviews.
This seems like a generic build quality issue.
Power button and the volume button of the phone is of very low build quality.
when the finish the call that time phone is not switch off  so i can return this phone  i am not happy this product quality also not good.
Basic Call feature is not up to mark   like sound quality  speaker quality  vibration etc.
1. call quality is good  
--------------------------------------------------------
nice speakers  12
the sound is low for media  ringtone or speaker but good enough for regular phone usage  
Phone heats up like hell during 3g use around camera and ear speaker region.
2  The speaker is not loud  but it is ok. And I mostly use headphones to hear songs or watch movies  which is awesome.
Now the speaker is loud enough and heating reduced quite significantly.
As many mentioned here  it s not over heating  not even before the update and no low ring volume issue found  the loud speaker is loud enough for a phone.
low speaker sound cant hear from beyond 7.
Loud Speaker is not great  OK sound
To add to these  the battery is quite long lasting  the body is slim and sleek  the sound quality is good  speaker isnt too loud  but very clear  and the UI is beautiful  takes one day to get around  but you ll love it .
Loud speaker is crisp and loud.
low volume in external speaker and headphones is another drawback.
After contacting service centre  i got reply that it is just default speaker with volume level  and that cannot be changed.
The sound of the speaker is decent but as it is located at the back of the phone  the sound may be masked if the device is kept at a surface like the pillow or a bed mattress.
--------------------------------------------------------
experience  12
Giving me a wallet balance for products purchased from WS retail forces me to buy further products from them which I am not interested in after this experience.
However not so bad experience so I will rate 3 on this parameter.
I have been a Fan of MI products but with the present experience learnt it the hard way.
I was a very refreshing experience.
The speakers and the buttons on the phone are well designed and of high build quality  offering a great user experience.
Got Update of about 60 MB on 21 May and it become lots more smoother experience.
Pathetic experience  if they find any manufacturing defect in the phone they will say that liquid has been found inside.
my overall experience and review is very bad.
It will give you the best 3g experience.
ups with customer care were a nightmarish experience.
the display the camera the overall touch experience and the built quality with a slim design its really brilliant.
horrible experience .
A very bad experience as I could not utilise advantages of Big Billion day sale.
All this incident has been a BITTER experience for me and if such a thing continues  FLIPKART s reputation would not last long.
Its really a bitter experience to buy Xiaomi Mi 4i 
Xiomi guys show asphalt 8 running on this device which is a trap as it runs with many frame losses and gaming experience is very bad.
bad experience 
Mi 3 was amazing  great smooth experience.
Phone will heat up if you play a lot of games and use heavy duty apps but since I personally don t play that much and use the phone for things Whatsapp  Instagram  Facebook  Twitter and stuff  in my own personal experience till now   3 weeks  the phone has not heated up that much like my other phones have.
NOTE  This is the behavior experience of my product.
Browsing is good experience due to full hd screen.
Purchased a terribly elegant white Xiaomi mi4i with a COD last week from flipkart and must say it was a fantastic experience.
my second worst experience with Flipkart.
Its worst experience in my life that I bought this mobile from Flipkart.
And the miui over android gives a very much an iOS like experience which is also really great.
I ordered it on 7th and got it on 12th April and this is my first Xiomi experience.
Entering into Android platform with this awesome machine is truly an amazing experience.
I will tell you my whole experience beginning from the unboxing of set till being fully operational as follows .
And if it does not offer a good calling experience than how can one rate it as a mobile phone.
hand experience is more important.
MIUI will give you a pleasant experience.
I have good experience of 2 Mi phones  still I was little cautious while ordering Mi 4i.
Now for the features and my own personal experience.
Purchased this near to a month ago  Well i have used a range of smartphones  as moto g2 brokedown expecting a high spec phone and with a awesome experience from mi3  purchased it last month.
So overall till now  a pleasant experience for me   
After using 7 days with moderate to heavy usage my experience is very good.
Kindly add Local Indian Languages in this mobile handset for better Experience.
--------------------------------------------------------
days of usage  -11
I m not that tech savvy but with regular usage  Which in my world means a bit of WhatsApp  You tube videos for my Kid  phone calls for close to 15.
So please those who have less usage of phone can buy  but for more usage this phone is not advisable so please think before buying and about the SAR value of this mobile you will not find any details in the internet and at the back side of mobile it is mentioned that 1.
It gets slightly warm during heavy usage but that is acceptable.
It does get a bit warm after an heavy usage.
At heavy usage  it lasts a whole day.
7 hours even on very low usage.
5Ghz processors which consumes much more power  with the same usage pattern.
Only the first day of usage was good to experience.
The battery easily lasts for little more than a day  on moderate usage.
6hrs with heavy usage.
Gets bit of heating during charging and while gaming or on heavy usage.
No lag at all in my experience even with heave usage of game.
5 to 2 days with high usage.
I would say 9hours of average usage .
I hope I dont get that in future but based on my usage on first day.
It easily lasts over a day with regular usage.
With moderate usage with all time Wifi mobile net on with 2 sims and all time sync with 2 gmail  whatsapp  fb it is going on for more than 24 hours.
thats normal with intensive usage.
Lasts a day even with moderate to heavy usage.
The reviews below are long  but I thought that it might help someone for effective usage of product.
the battery is amazing its last a full 24 hours   and that too on heavy usage except games.
For some  heavy usage is playing games all the day where display as well as processor  ram will be running at high speed.
intensive usage  certainly  heating during 3d gaming is acceptable  but during talking with 3G off .
And am using wifi on which its giving me backup of 11 HRS with regular usage on Balanced Mode.
Before buying this device  I read tons of review and how it became hot even after slight usage.
Yes after a continuous usage of camera  wifi  charging and gaming the phone heats up in about an hours time  but the good thing is it cools down within 10 mins of stand.
5  Very good battery  during few of the less usage days  didn t charged it for two days straight.
15 days of usage  I did not use it for long after the purchase  I was supposed to give it as a gift to family .
5 days with average usage.
here are my observations after few days of heavy usage  
Phone gets heated up very much around the camera and the call speaker area just after slight usage.
10 hours on the basic usage.
18 Hrs of moderate usage.
One hand usage is good.
Battery will not last more than 24hrs with heavy usage  WiFi  gps  some games and some music .
I charge it to 100  in the morning and by the time I come home in the evening  the battery still remains at 70  or higher with normal usage throughout the day.
Fi on and medium usage like surfing web  youtube  playing music  I dont play games  battery is still 55  at the end of the day and you can easily use it till next day as well.
Lasts properly for a day and a half with heavy usage of the phone.
2  With a slight of high usage e. g. Long call  YouTube videos it heats like hell.
no extensive usage.
Leave alone heavy usage like gaming.
With the latest updates  the battery stands for 2 Days with casual usage.
The handset I got  comes with the latest MIUI 6 and I did not experience any heating problems even after testing it with heavy usage while accessing multiple apps  calls and even with heavy gaming.
Note that the heavy usage is different from person to person.
20hr of moderate usage with gaming  mobile.
so this can be an issue for hard usage  .
these are my initial comments  will put more after a long usage.
Full heating issue for any usage   this is after new update   not worth if heating issue is not resolved   and miui also not working some times   
This phone is Ideal for people who do not have too heavy usage of the phones and hence do not load too many apps on the phone.
Continuous usage will last for 5 to 6 hrs.
The OGS corning concore is resistant to scratches from daily usage.
This doesn t mean that the phone has to be in low performance mode all the time  since the balanced mode works very well and is optimum for regular usage.
even though reverse usage sound is very low .
18 hours with moderate usage.
25 day of battery under mixed usage of game and browsing 
--------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------
a little bit  -10
after using for three weeks i got a little bit.
Just a little bit  This feature makes the phone more pocket friendly and fits in hand perfectly.
Heats just a little bit while dealing with heavy gaming.
10  little bit similar with Apple  
just a little bit  But considering the price difference  I can say Xiaomi really worked hard on the Camera and Display of this phone.
but little bit heating issue.
If you play heavy games continuously for like 10 minutes or so  the phone heats up a little bit  but that is completely normal.
It may become a little bit warm when playing HD game   webpages using more graphics contents .
Little bit heating issue which is very common for all the high range processors mobile phones but nothing will get impact about performance  go for it  cheers  
I mainly do internet surfing little bit gaming photography music and youtube.
Ram availability is also little bit less that is 1GB approx.
If we compare Internet of same sim 3g on both set then Mi4i is little bit faster.
--------------------------------------------------------
high end games  9
High end games like Mortal Kombat  Modern combat 2  Real Steel champain  Asphalt 8  BIA 3  Future fight and lots of other applications runs very smoothly.
every phone gets heated up after using high graphic games and yes  Mi4i too get heated up.
The game can handle heavy games but the problem is heating U won t see any drop frames while playing Asphalt 8 and Modern combat in performance mode but Nova 3 lags.
2 Strong Wifi receiver when you compare it with other phones  even the high end ones 
Cons  But this mobile has heating problem when play cpu intensive games like FIFA.
Ofcourse if you play graphic extensive games like asphalt 8 it surely will heat up like anything.
30hrs of high end gaming and an hour of browsing.
performance   it is good i can say supports high graphic games like asphalt8 and many more.
No lags while playing high end games.
Its gives smooth play with most of the High End games like Asphalt 8.
It heats too much you can t even play games.
For Rs 9000 you can purchase a brand new high end phone from any Indian compnay with after sale service center everywhere in the country.
4  No lagging while playing heavy games like asphalt 8
Kinda disappointed again as there were no Earphones in the package as i expected it to be there with higher end models.
Its only 10gb that finally reaches on hand and downloading games such as asphault eats away 1.
can compare the picture quality with that of all high end samsung phones and iphone 5s .
This is the major drawback as it only has 12 gb available for use  which is not very much if you will install high end games  store Full HD movies  best part is it has OTG feature which means you can expand the storage depending upon the usage.
Main camera is awesome just like some high end mobile camera.
Higher graphic games like real racing 3 did have some lag even after switching to performance mode.
BTW all high end phones does get warm in similar circumstances and hot Indian weather.
Gaming  Very good high end gaming experience.
After updates and importing music and photos counting to nearly 2 GB  I was left with 8 GB of space to install apps and games  but considering the fact I do not play heavy games  it s not an issue for me.
I am not a high end gamer so can t comment on that end.
People say it is average as they compare it with high end mobile  Ofcourse you will get good config if you send more money
Phone is slow and not working fast in heavy games.
Device is getting heated up so quickly while making calls and playing low end games such as Candy Crush for 10 mins.
If you play heavy games continuously for like 10 minutes or so  the phone heats up a little bit  but that is completely normal.
Coming to performance  I am able to play alphat 8 high end game  with out any lag.
PPI of 441 offers excellent viewing display at par with high end samsung mobiles when it comes to display quality. 
this is something great which is not available in most high end phone.
sometimes phone heats up while talking longtime or playing graphic intensive games.
I have not tried games on this mobile as I am not a game enthusiast.
I installed some games such as asphalt 8   dead trigger 2 played both games the device performed very good with some unnoticeable minute lags of course during this time the device starts heating up with very light increase in temperature.
Don t compare with high end mobiles  Sorry i don t say like that     .
i have not tested with high end gaming
But I tried small games that my sis might play like subway surfers and temple run.
I have downloaded much heavier games and played them along many applications running simultaneously.
 Great phone  thin light fast  good in every aspect a smartphone should be  exept  the phone heats up pretty quick  if you play high end games.
play  Tap the frog  or any similar games  then you will understand the touch sensitivy n responses  but normal using you will not get the touch prob in notice.
Great build  looks like a high end phone.
My old 512 mb ram powered android ics mobile was better when it was new in playing games of its time.
Overall it is nice deal and you can easily beat the high end phones around 20 000 .
Little warming up while playing games
This gives competion to all high end mobiles without any drawbacks.
Infact whole day it was getting warm while playing high end games and 3g browsing.
accommodates most of the high end phone features  what more can we ask for in 12 999 
I bought this for my mother who will obviously not be using it for intense games and high load apps.
i took exam by ashphalt 8  GTA san andreas NFS most wanted  MC 4 MC 59 known as heavy games.
Like all phones  it gets a bit warm if you use it while charging and also for highly intensive games.
You can t play HD games its slow down the game speed.
no heavy heating issue even with heavy games  except during charging the mobile  compared to the other mobiles having 615soc.
I play graphic intensive games and the device does get warm not too hot  with latest update .

COMPLETELY SATISFIED   value for money nice design build and display

The best value for money deal available for smartphones in this range.
Great value for money  If you are looking for a good value for money phone then go for it.
A good value for money but for heating and signal issues.
Sound output is little low  but with other awesome features  this is really one of the great value for money phone.
To sum it up  you cannot get a more sophisticated  value for money device for this price.
Overall its a great value for money   I would like to give it a rating of 4.
configuration wise a very good value for money.
solid value for money.
--------------------------------------------------------
no heating issues  7
Ram is a 2gb is inf but so taking issues is available.
infact the new one along with the heating issues has various other small issues like light sensors not working  wifi was not working properly.
2 or S3 or Wildfire S. I thought of returning it because of the heating and signal issues.
I bought this phone on 07th May Sale keeping in mind the heating issues but I know my usage very well and also I did checked out the Mi 4 at the Local Mobile store.
Even though the phone is a good budget phone  it has various issues.
So far i havent even experienced much talked heating issues.
Handset touch response is totally poor   Heating issues.
And the list has so many other issues.
I have got these issues in less than 2 month of usage  I dont know how many such defects are yet to come.
Initially I was really disappointed to see many issues like lagging  heating  camera  slow process etc.
A good value for money but for heating and signal issues.
These problems which i am facing is common to many users and miui forum is filled with people facing same issues.
MIUI is great and no other issues observed.
No major or even any minor issues occurred till now.
This phone heats up normally like every other phone  it has no extensive heating issues like every other person has been complaing about in their reviews.
When I first reported this problem to Flipkart they did provide me a replacement but that new one had the same issues as well.
2 major issues 
The major issues were  . 
Great phone  6 months have been using this phone  no issues  working good 
but little heating issues.
I got this phone on saturday and observed the following issues.
--------------------------------------------------------
apps  -6
Though the battery capacity is really good  I don t get a very good backup as I use too many things on the phone and some heavy apps.
Including the screen size  resolution  camera quality  battery life and speed of apps like camera  email  and all productive apps.
It does get heated a little while charging and when running heavy apps.
Used some social apps   3 browsers continuesly.
Lollipop support the latest apps and no lag at all.
Battery also drops a lot even after disabling unwanted apps with reduced brightness 
2GB RAM but after using 2 3 apps Free RAM only 400 MB
need to clean other apps recently you were working with again and again.
Downloading was very good while installing apps
It also have many very useful and creative apps.
From the day I have purchased  I noticed that fully charged battery holds good only for 4 hours max 5 hours  please note except WHATSAPP and WECHAT  no other social apps are used like FACEBOOK   Twitter etc.
Tried multi tasking such as running browser then minimizing it and running other apps such as whatsapp FB  Pdf reader etc.
4 GB of ram i have not installet any other apps or running anything but always show 890 or 640 free of 2GB.
All other apps were running in background.
5  Apps open real fast  if you can go to developer mode and increase the speed of animator by .
65 GHz for heavy apps.
Unable to see the pictures  videos and music  need to download various related apps to listen music  photoes etc.
The MIUI apps are good and the UI is very nicely designed giving a rich user experience.
Every single game and apps that I ve tried are working perfectly fine and smoothly.
There is a noticeable lag in everything you operate  right from performing basic tasks to opening new apps.
3. major apps some function do not work  example.
Other apps performed well.
It always shows available RAM less than 1 GB even when no other apps were installed .
With a week of usage only i found that the phone was rapidly heating even when it doesnt have any other apps installed than the ones that came with phone.
All apps are smooth like Butter.
The snapdragon 615 processor is decent if you use only productive apps  like Facebook   whatsapp   viber and other common apps .
Available Ram is below 500mb with minimum apps installed.
in equalizer does a wonderful job and it works even if you try it with internet radio apps such as Gaana  Murfie and more.
--------------------------------------------------------
slim  6
For rest I would say the phone is absolutely made up of good material no cheap feeling except for plastic back cover slim   light though i find it slippery but i just came in from Moto G universe where there is too much of gravity.
The phone is light and quite slim.
very compact slim
Coming to the product  the overall appearance of the phone is strikingly attractive  slim and neat and above all extremely light.
this a small slim and sleekly micro oven.
But  due to its slim profile  the gyroscopic sensors placed near the secondary mic.
6. good slim
 A very good crafted super slim phone.
nice   slim and very light.
--------------------------------------------------------
miui  6
I never want to mention about the specs as Flipkart already did it  Flipkart delivered the product in 2 days  When I first booted the phone  as others said  it got heated  But as we use  the phone never gets heated too much except while charging  The display is great  The phone s performance is extraordinary  The MIUI is buttery smooth  No need of extra launchers 
updated MIUI latest patch but still issue persist 
MIUI is easy to use and has many unique features like clean up and scan.
Options in MIUI 6 are pretty good but there are lot many bugs.
and MIUI 6 is really complex.
Super performance  except few lags due to new Miui on Lollipop  I am sure it will be fixed in future updates  bcoz I have seen Miui6 on Redmi Note without such lags in balanced mode  And this is 64. bit processor  so once all apps are tuned for 64. bit then phone will rock .
I tried changing the sim cards  changed the network mode  2g  3g LTE  updated the latest MIUI to  6.
It has a good display nice build nice camera and MIUI is also nice and There is no lag while playing games and the nice thing is that it charges very quickly.
MIUI is great.
MIUI is horribly slow when switching between apps.
Save me a lot of bucks and with the new miui 7 upgrade its super smooth and it has brought my lost love for androids back.
MIUI is bit unfriendly for new users.
Camera quality is far better than other 13 mp camera  MIUI is too good and user friendl  drawback are that had only 16gb internal memory and dont have any external memory card slot  also has medium heating issue.
1  the MIUI lags a little rarely .
The rest is all eaten by the heavy MIUI.
 MIUI simply great
5 MIUI stable version 
I wants to solve the heating issue to my Mi 4i   and RAM fluids issues  Camera  MIUI 6   other are manageable and good .
So I chose Mi4i as I liked its design  it fits my current budget and wanted to get hang of so hyped MiUi 6 .
Initially phone gets heated up but it overcomes by updating with latest MIUI.
The handset I got  comes with the latest MIUI 6 and I did not experience any heating problems even after testing it with heavy usage while accessing multiple apps  calls and even with heavy gaming.
MiUI 6 is so good
I was really happy with the MIUI.
The deciding factor for some of you  2GB seems awesome but it might be MIUI or something else but the end user only gets around 700MB of RAM.
Miui 6 is great it gives the user chance to customise your device completely.
3  i love miui.
MIUI is great and no other issues observed.
performance and lagging with latest MiUi.
After getting used to stock android Lollipop getting acclimatized with MIUI is difficult.
2  Great design and awesome MIUI interface.
MIUI is really good
after using for more than 3 days and updating to latest miui  Which took almost an hour or two i dont know why    it seems phone is not heating too much but still it has heating issues no doubt but only the upper half gets heated.
--------------------------------------------------------
replacement  -6
I called to Flipkart and ask for replacement defective phone 
When I first reported this problem to Flipkart they did provide me a replacement but that new one had the same issues as well.
returning back asking for replacement   will review again post replacement 
Though i gave it for a replacement when i enquired after twenty days the Service center replied that it might still take more than a month as Xiaomi is not supplying any spares for Mi 4i.
the touch is not working flipkart not ready to give replacement .
Rating still at 1 until I get the new replacement device and check it.
We are unable to process your replacement request.
The new replacement phone seems to be working fine.
--------------------------------------------------------
for first time  5
I have gifted  Mi4i  to someone and for the first time in my gifting history this gift has embarrassed me by coming back to me with the name of a  BOILER .
Those who are using it for the first time will find it impressive and again I would say it is very good.
BATTERY the above being said apart from the first time i ve never need to charge my phone from 0 to 100 ps this depends on user to user usage and therefore is subjective .
68gb of which is available for applications and user date when you boot up the phone for the first time.
For the first time i am feeling cheated by Flipkart.
Whats more this is the third callback time that you gave me after my first one in which you asked to download an app which you would send a link for and never send it till this date.
Sorry to say this  for the first time i am experiencing bad customer responses from Flipkart.
The device heats up a bit  but there are no phones in market that doesn t heat up and also I heard the heating issue is resolved in the immediate OTA update which pops up as soon as you switch on for the first time  800 MB  which I haven t done so far.
for the first time when i turned on the device got heated up within moments but after that its normal not much heating update the software there is a software available.
--------------------------------------------------------
look and feel  5
a total eye candy  The look and feel is just amazing.
It gives you a premium feel when you touch.
The feel holding itself pretty good  can use d phone in one hand  no fingerprints on the back Full HD display   camera quality is superb with low and bright glaring light.
Don t Dont feel like carrying a mobile such a light weight.
very good look and good feel while handling the phone 430 ppi display is very good rear camera is very clear but the problem with the phone the Mi interface not user friendly  worst part of the phone is very bad service support and customer support and net work connectivity.
I don t feel proud buying Mi 4i for other phones.
It is unibody design that lends it a very solid look and feel.
The feel holding itself pretty good  can use d phone in one hand  no fingerprints on the back
MI UI is good but didnt feel great.
Touch feel is very good.
Feel is good.
The cellular device itself looks very nice and gives us a premium feel.
I am not expecting at par performance with the M8 because few phones can match its performance but if the Mi 4i can even come 70  close to meeting the M8 s awesome feel I will be grateful.
The phone responds really well and doesn t feel like a low priced one.
They have better quality products within the same price range and brand feel is good.
--------------------------------------------------------
in low light  -5
Camera image is very bad in low light  not even equal to 5 MP 
The camera is top notch in every way  be it picture quality or other features  It even has a manual mode  The flash works pretty well  giving out the same results that a DSLR would give in low light.
Camera in day light is awesome
Sunlight visibility is good  but the sunlight feature what they described works only when you put torch light on the light sensor.
FRont and rear work extremely well in good light conditions in low light gives some grains bt that is with all the midrange devices.
So much light weight that my friends said it will fly off from one s hands  In terms of looks  I will give it 5 stars  
Slim  light  powerful  almost scratch proof  all around  great great screen  amazing battery  fantastic cameras.
Both the front and back cameras excel in taking photos in low light  out door.
as who clicks pics in low light and all.
Design is really good  light weight almost wafer like  
In low light visible noise.
camera is good in bright day light  but very very poor in low or dim light.
Color are under saturated low light pictures are noisy and dull.
Looking sleek   light.
adjusts screen brightness automatically in sunlight or low light
 Great phone  thin light fast  good in every aspect a smartphone should be  exept  the phone heats up pretty quick  if you play high end games.
in night or low light there is noise in the image.
Grainy photos are produced due to low light.
However  the quality is not as good as in bright light in low light conditions but still is lot better.
Gives good photos in low light and amazing ones in good light 
Good Camera  but low light pictures are worse  once you copy to computer you can see completely blurred and grains.
7. the camera is descent takes good photograph but there is lot of noise in low light conditions which will literally spoil the pics so this phone doesn t perform well in Low light 
Photos taken under adequate light turned out to be rich in detail.
Recently released MIUI 7 based on Android Lollipop  is very stable  light and fast.
Especially in natural bright light.
--------------------------------------------------------
pros and cons  5
Pros   Elegant design  Light Weight.
Everyday i am spending some time to read the reviews of above said phones and i came to know that the major cons of the mi4i heating problem is resolved by an update from Xiaomi so took a chance and brought it.
 MI4i seems to be awesome mobile but with certain cons.
And this phone is full of awesomeness and very less of cons.
but with so many great things and pros there is just one major cons which surpasses all pros is that the heating issue.
Now coming over to the main part that is the pros and cons that would help you to understand better   
--------------------------------------------------------
update  -5
4 star phone  1 star less for Xiaomi s phone testing team for overheating issue  In India every smartphone user does not have wifi connection for such huge first update  with 1 extra star for its price   5 star phone.
HEATING do not believe the others  review of heating there s a software update available when u log into the phone install it.
though i received a update of 806 mb again a 56mb and first two tentions almost gone.
So before using the phone applying the latest update is highly recommended.
PS  the phone doesnt heat up much justifiable  after the latest update.
update into new and stable version.
Xaiomi is maintaing a website which is followed ever day and they collect reviews and bugs  then correct it in their next update.
the moment i connected to wifi  its ready for a new update from MI
hope this issue will solve in next update.
5  This phone has little heat while charging and operating it but i have updated the latest update which having 850 MB size and solved the issue after that so i would like to request to the comrades for patiently handle this issue before judge in to conclusions  
Hope it will be sorted in next update 
Hope those would be fixed in next update.
At first reviews got me scared but still I purchased it and when I got this phone my first attempt was the latest update and then there is NO HEATING ISSUE.
I had updated my phone almost immediately after opening the package  so I don t know about the heating issue before the update  but as of now  its completely fine.
After first update  this issue resolved 50 .
Although there were some lags but after the 800 mb update  its better now  And yeah  5 stars for its performance  software and heating  P 
last update of 6.
Heating issue was definitely there  though  doesn t bother me much  but after a recent update  it seems to have come under control.
There is a little heating issue even after the update  even though they claims that they have fixed it with the recent update  but not to the large extend.
make all apps updates and also it has new os update near about 800 Mb.
Update  After a recent update the battery performance has gone down substantially.
0 is a perfect bug free stable update.
BATTERY  Minimal heat generated  Used continuosly for 4 hrs   intensive Gaming  after the latest update by MIUI 6.
The display is amazing  the battery backup is nice on moderate use  did not experience any lag after the update  and the heating problem was totally solve after the latest update.
I play graphic intensive games and the device does get warm not too hot  with latest update .
I have yet not updated it to MIUI 6 whch is the latest stable update available now.
--------------------------------------------------------
xiaomi  5
I don t think i ll ever buy a xiaomi phone again.
The quality from the speaker is unacceptable there is a lot of distortion in the sound   you can compare the quality of sound by playing the default ringtones from any of the other Xiaomi products  they sound sweet. 
Only suggestion to flipkart or Xiaomi is please stop this nonse flash sale if this is marketting gimmick it is fine but have all the colors and provide sale and reachout to all people in one go.
Purchased a terribly elegant white Xiaomi mi4i with a COD last week from flipkart and must say it was a fantastic experience.
PS  I am not a new Xiaomi user.
This is my first Xiaomi phone and I couldnt ask for anything better.
It looks like Xiaomi is not willing to mend it s generic UI issues which spoils every model they launch even today.
 This is my first XIAOMI Phone.
 An excellent product by Xiaomi  I am very much satisfied with this mobile  this is premium mid range phone  why to pay Rs.
The Mi 4i is the first Xiaomi phone to be launched with Android 5.
GO FOR IT the best Xiaomi the best Xiaomi product.
I can not think xiaomi will give such a poor glass quality.
MIUI 6 runs well on lollipop and has a greater RAM optimisation compared to other Xiaomi devices.
just a little bit  But considering the price difference  I can say Xiaomi really worked hard on the Camera and Display of this phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
software  -5
No Heating issue   Please update the software   around 800Mb  and it should be fine   had updated as soon as I got phone.
But software MIUI is the most crappy software 
Software is sometimes buggy.
Only negative I can think of is small software lags which I hope will be fixed and
3  First grade front and back Camera with a great software supporting it.
An android device without future software updates is like a dead wood.
This phn is good but software is not too good.
It is just normal  I used the phone for about 4 hrs in a stretch both with and without updation to new software and both ways I found it like other smartphones in term of heating.
All in all if you compare battery  display  camera  built quality price  looks  software i give high five.
I have uploaded around 20  max 40 mb size apps to see the performance of mobile before that I have updated mobile software  800 mb size  and found only 5 gb space available.
Pls work on the software and make it more lag free.
and few other small software issues  No phone is perfect.
Appearance both of the hardware   software is superb 
Within few months of purchase  i have faced with several software and hardware issues.
MiPhone Manager software is also available to provide even more features like Casting screen to System without wifi.
Mui6 software is good but not as smooth as other Custom OS like cynogenmod .
for the first time when i turned on the device got heated up within moments but after that its normal not much heating update the software there is a software available.
It s an amazing software Whig require some bug fixes 
I put the same 3G sim in other phones and internet speed is so fabulous but this phone makes internet connection go slow though i keep updating software.
Appearance both of the hardware   software is superb  
--------------------------------------------------------
calls  -5
Little heating is still there while making calls but it is very tolerable.
8hrs and 3hrs music and 1hr of gaming and slight calls and it lasted with 2g on for 2 days.
U can miss many calls due to poor sound.
As i am not into mobile gaming and long calls  i am OK with the phone for now.
The game play and calls were also smooth.
The same goes for Missed calls.
Missed calls too often.
Tough to handle long calls like on whatsapp.
Only gaing time by giving missed calls every day.
But it doesn t heat even during long calls.
time  you have to check the call register to check if there is any missed calls.
For those rare long calls i use headphones as everybody should do to reduce the harm to your brain  .
Yes  i am not able to get calls  i am missing so many
--------------------------------------------------------
warm during browsing  -5
light warm during browsing  here i want to confirm that all octacores having the warm during browsing  its quite common   i also checked in lenovo a7000 and galaxy s4 has heating  gets warm during browsing 
i also quite confused to get or not but got it and checked warm is there during browsing.
--------------------------------------------------------
for 2 days  4
First of all fake 30 days return policy 2nd heating will not covered in return or replacrment even the temperature goes over 45 degree if need i will show the result.
though it doesn t last 2 full days even on battery saving 2G signal.
Its been 2 full days since I have been using this phone and here are my first impressions 
So just go for it  Battery needs charging only after 2 days of vigorous using  I am a satisfied customer.
 I got this mobile 2 days back.
--------------------------------------------------------
service of flipkart  4
if yours is new mobile y you want it to be service   i have used lot of mobile but got to say this mobile is only hype and flipkart is worst online shooping mart as if you go for replacement or return they will give you only one standard copy paste answer.
The pathetic quality of MI and poor service of Flipkart makes my buy regret.
Last of all  Flipkart service is ONE OF THE BEST and I have not experienced any problem in last 3 years with any replacement.
best service of flipkart.
Very happy with service of Flipkart but the back cover and screenguard could have been provided by same seller WSR unfortunately for these you havo to lookout for other sellers.
very bad service of flipkart for this product  i have tried for the replacement but the  engineers  are not approving.
--------------------------------------------------------
day to day  4
Feeling happy to see one day before delivery.
therafter they will not call you and postpone it to next day.
Mi4i has an additional feature where it enhances the darker colours when exposed to sunlight  allowing us to view every single detail on the screen outdoors on a sunny day.
On the very first day i charged to 100  and after using it for just 1 hour of data  and 20 mins of call  the battery was only 21  2 hours after the battery just died.
Gave me callback time for 1 30pm and called at 1 00pm when I was eating my lunch and said couldn t callback at assigned time and will allot me a new time on the next day  People have work to do.
Only the first day of usage was good to experience.
I am using this product from 28th may  bought in recent sale and from the very first day I am facing the performance issues with my Mi 4i respective to Battery performance Camera and most important phone speed performance.
now i have requested for a replacement and going to get my replacement in next day.
I have used it whole day today in AC I haven t found anything like that 
So let me explain my scenario where it stood for 1 full day.
With a single day use I was fully satisfied with the performance until I turned on the Primary Camera to shoot some pictures and videos.
Ulitmate photos in good lighting day light.
I dont know how i am going to manage my day to day work without a phone.
On next day again I raised the complain to get it exchanged which was followed by a call from flipkart and they mentioned some troubleshooting steps to be taken.
hangs from the first day   lumia 730 is much much better or moto g2 in this range.
Lasts a day even with moderate to heavy usage.
--------------------------------------------------------
in balanced mode  4
Ran Asphalt8 for 10 min in balanced mode  didn t face any UI lags  but the device became warm beside the camera  checked the temp .
Snapdragon processor even in balanced mode and 2GB LPDDR3 makes miui buttery smooth and fluid.
Antu benchmark scored about 39k in performance mode and about 28k in balanced mode.
This doesn t mean that the phone has to be in low performance mode all the time  since the balanced mode works very well and is optimum for regular usage.
Super performance  except few lags due to new Miui on Lollipop  I am sure it will be fixed in future updates  bcoz I have seen Miui6 on Redmi Note without such lags in balanced mode  And this is 64. bit processor  so once all apps are tuned for 64. bit then phone will rock .
Used the phone extensively in balanced mode
performance is too good  change the default settings to  performance mode  which will be in  balanced mode  in default to increase the device performance and speed .
Some lags are there while gaming on balanced mode.
In the balanced mode  it is sluggish and can at times hang on some apps  mine does on Murfie.
--------------------------------------------------------
playing games  -4
sometimes phone heats up while talking longtime or playing graphic intensive games.
The game can handle heavy games but the problem is heating U won t see any drop frames while playing Asphalt 8 and Modern combat in performance mode but Nova 3 lags.
Little warming up while playing games
THIRD DAY  NO HEATING ISSUE  NOT EVEN WHILE CHARGING AND PLAYING high end games.
Device is getting heated up so quickly while making calls and playing low end games such as Candy Crush for 10 mins.
4  No lagging while playing heavy games like asphalt 8
My old 512 mb ram powered android ics mobile was better when it was new in playing games of its time.
--------------------------------------------------------
external memory card  4
Phone does t have any external memory card slot which is biggest drawback of this phone because out of 16 Gb of internal memory
The camera quality is not as much good as 13mp  There is no slot for external memory card hence 12.
Of course  an external memory card slot would have been a major plus point  but quite frankly 16gb memory is enough.
only issue with the mobile is inserting an external memory card option is not there.
So far  this phone has been very impressive and I have no complaints  just a missing external memory card slot  which is not really a big deal .
Camera quality is far better than other 13 mp camera  MIUI is too good and user friendl  drawback are that had only 16gb internal memory and dont have any external memory card slot  also has medium heating issue.
--------------------------------------------------------
people  -3
Lets come to me perception   people who r saying its getting heated up during 1st boot  setting up the phone for the 1st time.
Only this time I want to discourage as many people as possible from buying it .
Stunning design will aww other people to ask you about the phone.
Overall  I will suggest people to stay away from this product.
I was shocked to see the large no of people lined up for repairs.
1 con people would say is the lack of expandable storage but she has a laptop and also the mobile has OTG support so no problem.
I have to ask people to be careful of such incidents happening to them.
Waste mgmt and technical people in flipkart.
1  How did I end up getting a defective device    it s not a one off case  if that s your argument  as I have now come to know many many people getting similar defective pieces.
 I bought this mobile mi4i on 14th  may I want to give review for this mobile because when I try to buy this mobile I keep on looking for the reviews which as pros and cons now I give my comments for the people s who trying to buy this Mobile 
If you can live with a bit of heating Problem   Its not that much as people have exaggerated  Then u should surely go for it.
There is undoubtedly a heating issue in the device  but not as much people are saying.
People say it is average as they compare it with high end mobile  Ofcourse you will get good config if you send more money
There are other people on their page reporting similar issues as well w. r. t. processing of refund.
Service center in chennai heactic always 40 people are present so this mean every one mobile have some defect.
Please ignore the comments of people who are not aware of how to update the smartphones and please go for it.
it s sincer request don t by any Mi phones from flipcart as this people making us fool by delivering faulty phones to match target.
--------------------------------------------------------
and light weight  3
the phone look styling and less weight.
although it makes the phone a bit bulkier compared to its original weight and thickness  
It is light weight  weighing less that the older Nokia which was not a 5  model.
Don t Dont feel like carrying a mobile such a light weight.
Design is really good  light weight almost wafer like  
very less weight 
Light weight and looks great.
slim sleek and light weight.
Less weight.
So much light weight that my friends said it will fly off from one s hands  In terms of looks  I will give it 5 stars  
It is very light weight and smaller in size.
Phone is good  light weight  great display  good amount of RAM  good front camera  battery charges quick   lasts more than 1 day.
--------------------------------------------------------
no screen guard  -3
Waiting for the original Screen Guard   will update once I get that.
There is some lag in UI  and after having the screen guard on  unofficial  it becomes unresponsive.
And yeah  do not forget to redeem your free screen guard which can be obtained from mi s website by entering your address phone.
Mi is offering free screen guard for its buyers   but its be around 10days since I placed my request for screen guard and haven t received it yet nor there is any tracking ID that was generated   so I have no idea how to track my request 
but one thing I must say if company ppl read this that company should provide atleat a screen guard since its a new model   no screen guard is available in the market.
Also got an email from Flipkart for free Screen Guard which will reach within 14days.
--------------------------------------------------------
service by flipkart  3
Very happy with service of Flipkart but the back cover and screenguard could have been provided by same seller WSR unfortunately for these you havo to lookout for other sellers.
As usual great service by Flipkart  on time delivery.
First the service given by the flipkart is great and the mobile is too good since from last 4 days I am using Mi4i there is no issue with Heating its happen only at updating the mobile at first about the camera good quality and over all 5 Star for this Mobile.
Excellent service by flipkart.
--------------------------------------------------------
customer care  -3
The same was also communicated by the customer care executive I spoke to.
I wrote an email to your customer care that I wont be able to pick up the call at this time on 22.
But Xiaomi India customer care is really poor as the questions I asked  under update 4  are still unanswered.
--------------------------------------------------------
scanned copy  3
Couriered my mobile back to flipkart and sent them a scanned copy of the courier charges as well.
 We also request you to email the scanned copy of receipt along with the tracking id  so that we can reimburse the courier charges in actuals.
They would refund the courier charges later on once I send a scanned copy of the bill.
--------------------------------------------------------
mi4i  2
Built of MI4I is fantastic  Very Very good looking .
Mi4i is a not a best but good .
Mi4i is a really superb for any normal phone user.
So I am proud to be owing Mi4I without any such a issue  
Without first update  Mi4i is another name of fry pan.
Though Mi4i looked simple to use.
Dual 4G are wasted here  MI4I phone is not enough to capable to switch different speed E   H   H    4G  its just simply failed to connect network.
Features and specifications of the Mi4i is very good.
Mi4i scores equal to nexus 4 on this aspect as Nexus 4 was also very beautiful.
 My First Impression with the Mi4i was awesome  when I unpacked it and opened it.
MI4I is great in terms of specifications and great performance .
Mi4i is good but cannot beat G3.
Finally  I m a happy Mi4i user  cannot take eyes of this display.
Just received shipment of the new Mi4i .
The look and feel of the Mi4i is really good.
The camera is not as good as Mi4i.
So I am sure that he sold refurbished product under diwali sale that s why he is denying to replace with same MI4i.
But I saw in filpkart MI4I available with different colour  I asked them that I am OK if they replace different colour to me  but they denied.
I am also using iPhone 5s   still I can t live without mi4i   particularly because of its camera.
overall mi4i is a good choice if camera and battery back up is not ur priority.
it is hell disappointing to say that  phones like MI4i are very negligent about their quality checks.
Manny time Mi4i will become Not reachable Switched off .
overall mi4i is worth for 13k   
same is with mi4i.
 I bought this mobile mi4i on 14th  may I want to give review for this mobile because when I try to buy this mobile I keep on looking for the reviews which as pros and cons now I give my comments for the people s who trying to buy this Mobile 
If any one purchasing this xiaomi mi4i mobile plz read it carefully or contact me sachin.
 I have use mi4i for 2 weeks and following are my experience.
in 13k u will not get better than mi4i.
Complete in all features and options  its a pleasure to possess MI4i better then other handsets in the market in the same price range 
 MI4i seems to be awesome mobile but with certain cons.
i bought a new Mi4i few days 40.
MI3 Silver color finishing is also awesome but Mi4i is not like so.

sd card slot  -2
no external SD card slot   for me it is ok bcz you will have 12.
my overall rating  for phone is 4 star only if they had micro sd card slot i would definetly give 5 star 
No expansion slot to add a memory card  so beware if you think otherwise.
 Very good phone but problem is that there is no excess slot for memory card .
Low battery backup is irritating and no external card slot is surprising.
--------------------------------------------------------
memory card slot  2
Not able to expand memory   No SD Card Slot .
Some heavy gamers may find no extra expandable memory card slot a bit dissapointment but for me  16 GB  its enough as I am not a heavy gamer .
The camera quality is not as much good as 13mp  There is no slot for external memory card hence 12.
Of course  an external memory card slot would have been a major plus point  but quite frankly 16gb memory is enough.
No expansion slot to add a memory card  so beware if you think otherwise.
Felt  16GB internal memory is quite insufficient without a SD card slot but can live with it as there is a USB OTG feature.
So far  this phone has been very impressive and I have no complaints  just a missing external memory card slot  which is not really a big deal .
Camera quality is far better than other 13 mp camera  MIUI is too good and user friendl  drawback are that had only 16gb internal memory and dont have any external memory card slot  also has medium heating issue.
Phone does t have any external memory card slot which is biggest drawback of this phone because out of 16 Gb of internal memory
 Very good phone but problem is that there is no excess slot for memory card .
--------------------------------------------------------
gaming  -2
Decent Gaming performance
intensive usage  certainly  heating during 3d gaming is acceptable  but during talking with 3G off .
As i am not into mobile gaming and long calls  i am OK with the phone for now.
but for 3000  mah battery i dont think it is enough when you use it for constant gaming and browsing it will last only up to 5.
NOTE   its still a Mobile Phone soo Dont Expect it not to Heat At All After heavy Gaming Sessions.
Heats up a lot even with casual gaming.
Overall gaming is not smooth even my older phones are better than this.
And for the ones who are thinking of playing games can also play it gives a great gaming performance.
Heats just a little bit while dealing with heavy gaming.
The handset I got  comes with the latest MIUI 6 and I did not experience any heating problems even after testing it with heavy usage while accessing multiple apps  calls and even with heavy gaming.
Gaming was just Ok with too much heating there is something strange in Mi 4i that even the Screen heats up dangerously.
In my Opinion definitely it heated up with online streaming on HD video and hard gaming  but it is natural for all smart phones.
16 GB is the only con with this phone but works for me  not much into mobile gaming and mobile videos you see  sufficient enough for me.
--------------------------------------------------------
to service center  2
Phone is with the service center for past 10 days expecting for the parts to arrive.
So when contacted customer care they told me to bring it to the service center whichever is suitable for me.
Better go for good brands  who having proper service center and a company who gonna treat their customers as King.
last week cell is not getting charged i went to service center they have cahrging card.
So if you buy xiaomi make sure you take care of it  if something happens to your mobile then I suggest you to go for a new mobile instead of their service centers.
Then i given mobile to service center at chennai.
Service center in chennai heactic always 40 people are present so this mean every one mobile have some defect.
--------------------------------------------------------
every  -2
Complete nightmare dealing with their solution experts as problem needs restating EVERY single time.
P. S  please do not over react on heating issue   specially on the first day  Every high end mobile gets warm 
--------------------------------------------------------
flipkart return policy  -2
 Flipkart has a wrong policy on return.
Amazon return policy is quite good compared to flipkart.
I request you  not to buy any item from flipkart because its return policy is irritating me now and i am very disappointed.
Return policy is bad.
The result will uploaded with hidden policy this all is done to reject the return or replacrment.
flipkart has very worst return policy.
bought this phone on the occassion of big billion day and like the other three devices i bought from Flipkart i. e Lenovo A6000 plus  Mi4i and Ambrane Powerbank all the devices turned out to be defective now pursuing after the so called easy return policy  hopefuuly some good will be done to the loss caused to me.
I try for return but not possible as per flipkart return policy.
Flipkart has pathetic return policy and worst customer service.
Flipkart return policy is very disgusting and annoying  as there s no option to refund money  when product sold was not upto mark.

I searched lot of mobile phones before buying it and would like to say that it is really a awesome awesome mobile phone produced by Xiaomi.
--------------------------------------------------------
need  1
Abruptly the display goes blank  black  need to wait a few seconds to allow recover itself.
This issue need to be resolve due to limited internal memory.
When we have HD recording  which fills memory at rapid speed  support to ext mem card is very much need

review  1
Well  this is an edit over my previous review.
Guys  please note that this is my honest review of using this phone for around 2 months.
This is my first review I never written reviews .
 Giving a clear and practical review after using for 3 weeks continuously.
I will come back with full review in couple of days.
my overall experience and review is very bad.
I dont know how much this review helps but if i was at your place i would have used that money somewhere else.
So here s my honest review about the product.
so watch every review in you tube before you judge  
Don t think about negative review.
Flipkart and the product company smartly pays for the good Review but restrict the genuine critics and bad reviews to avoid their sales effect .
 At first I would like to say Im a geek and im too much into tech and all so this review is heavy This phone is great in terms of features.
I hope my review will be helpful.
I multitask a lot and here s is my genuine review 
This is my first review for any phone.
More detailed review wil follow soon.
Also i have seen every single review on youtube spacially C4ETECH i want to tell them if your so called iPhone with dual core processor and with 1Gb ram become flagship device then open your eyes Mi 4i has 1.
Its genuine review after 5 days use.
and i l update the complete review soon

thanks to flipkart  1
Second thanks to Flipkart which delivered it to me in 3.
 its wonderful using mi 4i thanks to flipkart for giving the best phone at relevant price 
i bought this mobile on first flash sale and this mobile started heating like anything  please think twice before buying this mobile  MI is cheating the customers by selling this cheap mobile with high SAR value as u know higher the SAR value causes Cancer even i faced lot of problems with in two weeks of time and requested flipkart for replacement and after fighting for 9 days flipkart replaced the mobile thanks to flipkart but after replacement also am facing the same problem with this mobile You cannot speak more than 10 min in this mobile .

user  1
Yes  it heats a bit if you are a heavy user but not too much and its bearable for what you are getting for 13K.
i am a moderate user and i dont play games in mobile.
Video quality was ok. i did not face a heating problem till now yes iam a moderate user  the phone heats up when you use it for browsing internet for long time.
Gets heated easily but not too hot for a basic user.
expandable storage with about 11GB of user available memory.
Screen display touch is simply perfect and gives a flawless user experience.
For a moderate user it may run for a whole day.
I am not new user for you I have brought 5 phone from you for last 2 years.
heavy user.
So for a casual to medium user who wants an overall best  
850   900MB RAM available for user but it is still works fantastic.
wonderful user layout.
I am moderate user  no gaming but youtube videos  continuous Emails  Whatsapp  FB  zomato and lots of apps.
This phone is very much user friendly   really fast with some heating problem.
not very easy to understand for a standard user.
The MIUI apps are good and the UI is very nicely designed giving a rich user experience.
which is bcoz of snapdragon 615 processor but this phone does not heat up in day to day usage but if u are a heavy user the temp.
If you are a casual user  go for it.
If you are moderate user and you like sleek phones with good bright UI on top of it   please take this.
--------------------------------------------------------
after sale service  -1
After sales service is pathetic.
I sincerely hope 4i gives me flawless service of of at least an year and a half and that I do not get to test out their after sale service.
Recommendation  If you are worried about after sale service don t buy.
--------------------------------------------------------
available in market  1
No proper back covers available in the market.
guard   all which are not readily available in market.
--------------------------------------------------------
well  1
Heating  Well first thing I did when I got the phone was I updated it.
--------------------------------------------------------
think  -1
So please those who have less usage of phone can buy  but for more usage this phone is not advisable so please think before buying and about the SAR value of this mobile you will not find any details in the internet and at the back side of mobile it is mentioned that 1.
--------------------------------------------------------
waste of money  1
My advice would be don t go for this phone it only promises to be good but it is simply waste of money.
