The looks are this model of HTC Co. are very stylish  but battery backup is very poor and this I am teling without using NET and if u will use internet ur battery will drain out like waterso for 3G net users it is only good if the mobile is plugged.
found good but battery is not so good where as it is found dead when it is noon so it is not much satification 
battery backup is not good for such big screen.nice battery  19

bad performance  -6
Facing WIFI connectivity issue with this device how ever other devices are working with same signal and same configuration like moto g. etc  this is still giving poor performance like 1st generation of smart phone like Samsung and other devices.
 Performance not that good.
Now the product has many problems like no call indication very slow performance   now it is absolutely of no use.
average performance by batteryyy.
Verdict  Specs on the paper fall like marbles in comparison to the overall performance of this device.great performance  14
I bought this phone since I had HTC ONE V  it provided me good performance in Camera section with sharp images.
its very nice phone  looks build quality  performance  everything is good.
Specially performance is excellent.
Buyed it for my wife and in past one month the performance is good.
 I am using HTC 620G since 2 Weeks and it s performance is really good

--------------------------------------------------------
worst mobile  -4
And one thing I recommend to the music lovers not to use the packed headphone as it is not good enough for your device.
 Htc is not a good mobile.
 I bought htc 620G from SalesEmporium via Flipkart  The phone itself is a great device to handle and use  Great performance and look in this range  But i received this phone with defective camera and the seller SalesEmporium refuses to give me replacement even i haven t inserted sim and all accessories was intact  Flipkart also didn t helped me  There email was not working   tried 2 time but showing over quota   and customer care on phone told me to install flipkart mobile app and even they rejected my claim.
HTC 620G is the worst device i have ever before .awesome mobile  11
very good mobile within budget 
Worth every penny of the 14k you spend for it   Most importantly   All you MOTO G lovers do check this phone out   with just 1k more price it gives you a much better device .
very good mobile front and back camera good quality performance also good.
The looks are this model of HTC Co. are very stylish  but battery backup is very poor and this I am teling without using NET and if u will use internet ur battery will drain out like waterso for 3G net users it is only good if the mobile is plugged.
 For the price its good mobile.
Decent device  but looks so damn plastic y  glossy back looks terrible  and is going to be a dirt magnet.
even i have purchased this device by seeing all the reviews but now i m very happy with the device performance.
Good mobile htc always good.
excellent mobile from htc a good piece for less price https www.
The management of battery power in the device is very efficient.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad display  -6
It is a looonggg phone with a laargee display.

display not working well it it reflecting in background of same display 
--------------------------------------------------------
looks  7
you can choose between this and moto g. you get better hardware and classy looks in htc and better software android lollipop.
Screen is great  looks stand out in the crowd and are very impressive  white .
1  Good Looks but Cheap Built and feel.
 Good looks  expandable memory light weight  ram is ok  available 4 gb out of total 8 gb internal memory  YES IT SUPPORTS OTG
1  Amazing looks .
Attractive Looks
--------------------------------------------------------
internal memory  6
One major drawback is that u cannot move apps from phone memory to memory card and it has only four gb memory avilable for user which make u upset.
The memory you get is little over 4GB  the default disk can be changed but it still will store some data in phone memory. 
8GB onboard memory  but only 4 GB available user memory 
this is out dated phone who expect update like lollipop and updated apps don t go for this  internal memory available only 4gb.
4 gb of internal memory for user apps.
 don t buy any thing from flipkart it cheeting with customer 4GB except 8GB internal memory HTC Desire 626G
please include the internal memory of mobile in your refine.
Even 8GB internal memory user can use only 4.
 Good looks  expandable memory light weight  ram is ok  available 4 gb out of total 8 gb internal memory  YES IT SUPPORTS OTG

All i need was a smart phone with a good processor and not the extraordinary 1  after all i was planning to buy a smart phone and not a laptop or a PC with such and such processor s and etc.
processor is good 1.
and processor is good
--------------------------------------------------------
apps to sd  -4
So you can install only limited apps without deleting the existing apps.
You cannot load much apps and have to be selective.
add a few apps and it goes slow.
battery is not meeting as per specification  apps are not able to move for memory card.
39GB is enough but the apps can be moved after rooting.
4 heavy apps.
The third party apps present in the phone cannot be hosted directly from the ext3  that is the external SD card as only the apps data is stored in the memory card.
--------------------------------------------------------
samsung galaxy  4
camera result is poor compared to other products of sony and samsung galaxy grand or blackberry z10 in same segment of 8 megapixel.
In this price Samsung is better to buy.
5. much better than moto E 2nd genration and samsung grand 2 and other mobile of samsung and micromax 
Its feel and look is best than the same typical Samsung phones.
but finally i should go for samsung grand 2 r moto g2   
--------------------------------------------------------
bad_speaker  -4
10  Average Speaker and a very bad stock music player.
only the lower speaker works when you watch some video or talk to someone on loudspeaker.
Front facing loudspeaker   as per spec on various sites  they say it has stereo speakers but only lower speaker works when phone rings and you play music

octa core processor  3
3. processor is good.
bad processor
performance and processor is excallent 
If you take a look at other smartphones  the processor will either be of quad core or of dual core but OCTA CORE is rare and trust me  THIS PHONE IS FREAKIN  FAST   AND NO BOILING AT THE BACK  D Again a BIG thumbs up for the performance of this phone.
mediatek octa core processor which runs without any lag.
you wont get such processor from relevant companies at this price.
Good processor and ram   
nd also good processor.
Compaire with moto G and i found this is a better option  stunning looks with great processor.
All i need was a smart phone with a good processor and not the extraordinary 1  after all i was planning to buy a smart phone and not a laptop or a PC with such and such processor s and etc.
a smooth fast octa core processor will redefine your device.
The CPU is Octacore  but it is slower than a dual core CPU.
 1. true octa core processor
HTC Desire 620g DS is xcellent phone in terms of battery backup  processor outstanding  screen resolution damm good nd everything working well.

music lovers  -3
Music lovers there isnt much for you.
My Lumia 520 gives much much better music output.
I used only one sim and average wifi browsing 3hrs a day and average music play 30minutes a day 
If your not that much into music and this fits in your budget.
Speaker volume is a bit low and speakers output music also not that good.
--------------------------------------------------------
user interface  -3
If anyone is a moderate user and is satisfied with 1 gig ram then go for it.
iam the previous user of samsung s duos 1   duos 2 .
The phone is quite good in respect to an average user but not good for those who are always hooked up due to fast consumption of battery power.
I am using this product from two months it is best phone for a regular user.
--------------------------------------------------------

touch screen  1
very smooth and fast touch screen.

5mm jack  any good brand headphones can be replaced instead of the inbox pair  and ofcourse   the clarity of sound is awesome if you use any THIRD PARTY headphone.
Price is bit high compared to other brand products.
in the matter of hand set quality  brand new and well packed   and delivery time was satisfied by flipkart .
As an HTC Desire user  I like the mobile brand.
the only reason you should buy this phone is if you are brand concious.
