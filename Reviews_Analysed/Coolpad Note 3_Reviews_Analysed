But if you want better performance and battery life  spend a little and go for redmi note 3 ZUK Z1 or the meizu note 3.

coolpad note  4
First things first  The Note 3 Plus variant is not a worthy upgrade over the regular Coolpad note 3.
I have purchased Coolpad note3 pluse  4days back  I was very disappointed by it s Camera  13MP It s not even 5MP  giving normal images with very bad resolution.
Two month before i bought lenovo k4 n now coolpad note 3 plus so i want to say that coolpad is best in comparing with lenovo k4.
CONCLUDING my review  To be frank  Coolpad is providing a lot at this price.
but my coolpad note 3 plus dose not focus like that when i move that rader i cant see any changes like focusing or something.
That is only one parameter where lenovo wins rest things of coolpad is better than lenovo k4This mobike is awsm i wil be give it 5 into 5 stars camera quality is best price is very low all features in this mobile  looks like iphone 6Good phone but there is some heating issuesbattery backup is poor while the phone is gooodGood mobile for best price.
--------------------------------------------------------
bad display  -3
With the 1080p display and a 400  ppi the display will be sharper.
The 720p display version of coolpad note 3 is also good  the display is fine and nothing bad about it.good display  4
display is crisp and clear performance is very good front camera is very nice where as back camera works very good in day light but average in low light.
what great phone with great display and awesome sound quality very cool smartphoneBetter than bestNice and amazingGreat phone at this price  No heating issues  decent battery life  user friendly.
