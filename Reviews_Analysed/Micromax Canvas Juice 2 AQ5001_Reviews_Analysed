micromax service center  -1
When I contacted Micromax service center they able to solve this problem by reinstalling some software.
while i try to up roach micromax service center they said very clearly i need to pay 2000rs for this.
BUT  amazon customer service guys suggested me to meet Micromax service center for same.
As its easy to find micromax service center compare to other Chinese brands.
This is the worst product ever from Micromax i have purchased with in short period the motherboard and battery both are gone at time and i need to procure one more mobile for my day to day activities   which is additional burden because of sluggish service support from after sales service of micromax.
