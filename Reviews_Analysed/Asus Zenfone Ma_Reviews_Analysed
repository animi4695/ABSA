 i thought i received defective device from flipkart.
100 percent but it will be worth the wait because you can rest assured the device will last you for two whole days even with wifi  4G    over 10  hours of on screen time.
I d like to end this review with a note of sincere thanks to other reviewers who helped me decide to make this purchase and a kudos to Flipkart and WS Retail for promptly replacing the first device with a second and then diligently providing a refund when even the second device showed manufacturing defects pertaing to the sound system.
Instead of buying any unbranded device of same cost with higher specs its really worth buying this branded device.
Camera is good   but it takes time to click a picture   slow capture     1st week i was happy that i bought a good mobile but now i m feeling why i bought this

processor  9
Can expect better processor I think snapdragon 410 is quite low
Processor is good.
Considering the processor and other .
Processor is quite good and most of the apps run smooth 
due to low processor.
So 1ghz processor is good enough.
Processor good
even the phone having a good processor and 2 gb ram
Good processor.
the phone looks really good with awesome processor performance.
the only thing the phone lags behind due its poor processor speed.
Asus can also think for handset with better Processor   higher RAM with 5000mah battery in a price of 13K 
4. good processor .
processor is very good.
 Sexy phone and awesome battery back up very big in size bigger than redmi note 4 but the only problem is with the processor very poor in performance it wont support big apps and often hangs apart from this every thing is superb minimum 9 hours usage on gaming

Rear Camera is not for taking shots in low light.
Both cameras work superb in sun light but in artificial sunlight they are not that good.
clicks pretty fine pictures in day light and decent pictures in low light as well.
Front camera is decent but there are grains in low light atmosphere.
Low light camera mode is awesome.
camera in low light is not good
forget about low light.
Tho the camera is not upto the par But even than it can click good pictures in bright light But low light shots can get grainy.

--------------------------------------------------------
a long time  -6
5 yr old phone  and I hope will last a long time without slowing down.
It takes a long time to charge but thats not a problem becaue your battery will last at least of 36.
Only issue is it s taking vary long time to charge and speaker quality is poor.
Phone weight is more  make your hand in pain while play game for a long time  Measurable because of 5000 mah battery  
Long time charging of 4hours for 5000mhz battery.
even i am buying product from flipkart from a long time.
 Have been using this phone for a long time and have not encountered any problem.
I was planning to get this mobile for a long time and finally got this last week.
Gaming experience is outstanding checked Asphalt 8 Airborne  Modern Combat SBK 15 etc  best part is even after playing game for long time the device doesn t heat.

3  exposure value is always high  that means   every time you have to manually decrease the EV value while capturing a picture of a written page or news paper  otherwise picture will come out very whitish and unreadable  
In short value for money product.

fit n finish super 
Super happy with the performance.
--------------------------------------------------------
no heating issues  -5
Fix the lagging issues in next update plzzz.
Everything you are expecting is perfect  only issues are  it does not contain headphone   though it has the hole to use a headphone  so you can buy one .
I have returned two phone as they were having same issues.
 Battery backup awesome  leather finish feels good  smooth touch  till now no slow issues   
Phone wise its good but the only problem is touch issues that too dailpad replaced ths product but still the same issue exists.
--------------------------------------------------------
speed  5
Good speed
processor very low speed of 1 GHZ for around 10000 Rupees.
Speed is good but once it gets hanged I don t know why
Very good speed.
But I need to have high speed memory cards for various reason thats why I returned my device and got my refund.
Processor speed is decent  enough for normal uses.
Speed is so fast with 2 GB Ram .

zen ui  4
Zen UI is pretty smooth and lag free.
And at last the Zen UI is far better than other UI.
The ZEN UI is not as intuitive and user friendly as vanilla Android or other versions from Sony or Samsung
the best design I can say among all the Zenfone 2 model  battery back up excellent  UI super.
3  Excellent Zen UI interface with many handy features but it consumes extra space in its 2GB RAM.
the Zen UI is also quite helpful and easy on the hand.
Good Zen GUI
Zen UI is good and there are lots of UI customization themes provided by ASUS  so no need to go for any kind of launchers.
Impressive in terms of build quality  looks  grip  ZEN UI on top of Android  Battery life  Shooting modes. 
--------------------------------------------------------
viewing angles  4
2  The screen has some nice viewing angles and sunlight readability is upto the mark.
viewing angles are good.
5 with HD display  CG glass 4 is good  and the viewing angles are also good.
--------------------------------------------------------
memory card  -4
38GB could we use from internal memory.
The 2gb ram memory is worthless when it comes to high multitasking.
Firstly i thought that it was a problem with Memory Card  I formatted the memory card through my phone  didn t helped  try to use the same memory card with my J2.
only issue is low in internal memory.
20 applications and i still get free Memory of around 800.
It is providing 16 gb internal memory from which 10 gb is for user.
3  Supports 64GB external memory card and OTG pendrive as well.
2GB RAM and 16 GB internal memory was sufficient for me 
 one can surely get an external memory card if one is interested in songs and videos stuff  
I am having 32gb Scan Disk ultra Micro SD after inserting it into memory slot of the phone  the device randomly removes my Memory Card and reinsert the same.
Good memory  good camera.
--------------------------------------------------------
user interface  -4
Most important part is Battery  if you are moderate user then you can use yiour zenfone maX without charging for at least 2 to 3 days.
And the best feature its user friendly interface for camera which has a manual mode i. e. you can change attributes of the camera to take better photos.
Totally best buy for daily usage and average user.
im a heavy user.
go for it if u are a heavy user and fan of camera and battery backup.
well you can be assured of it as an average user the battery last for 2 days
I am not a heavy user not installed any gaming apps 
This is more than enough for regular user  and entertainment addicts and average gamers.
I am not a heavy rough user of Android and also not a good gamer but I play Clash of clans  p. I make phone calls a lot  so I was searching for a good phone with good camera quality and battery  finally i found this.
User friendly GUI and functionalities
Normal user will get 3 days of battery life and for heavy user 2 full days.
User Interface quiet good as MI devices 
If you are a moderate user like me then it will be the best choice.
This smartphone is good choice for average user .

asus zenfone max  4
Due to this experience am a anti Asus now.
If you play same video on samsung   asus zenfone max  you will be able to understand the difference.
ASUS Zenfone Max is Excellent 
 a nice product from asus  first i used zenfone 5 for 1 year  i was quite satisfied with that and then i purchased max  and really i am happy with asus phone 
Best Asus Product Ever.
THe original Asus website also mentions that ZC550KL is the correct model of zenfone max.
its a really nice phone but not compare to samsung on7   samsung on7 much better asus zenfone max
My first asus phone is zenfone 5 and it s mike was gone under warranty.
OMG This asus zenfone max is unbelievable.
selfies with Zenfone max are elegant.
I earlier has Asus Zenfone 5 which worked great.
how can these things can happen to s brand new phone  i would strongly recommend everyone not to buy this particular model as few of my friends are using other asus models which are working absolutely fyn 
I also use Asus Zenfone Lesar 2 its so good But Zenfone Max is Not.
Hi  i m using asus zenfone max  great battery 1.
i think asus will be better .
 Very good product  this my second ASUS mobile phone  in this price .
features r too good in asus.
Asus is the best.
 Asus zenfone max good mobile.
Asus is good at this price range if u r looking for a decent performance battery driven phone.
In short  Asus Zenfone Max is a beast that comes under 10 K. Go for it.
Good Asus UI.
now we got a better ppi and speakers in this phone and as usual the phones look is deadly awesome like all other asus phones .
you cannot get a better than ASUS phone in this phone.
So  if u are a change lover  then probably go for ASUS on a whole if not zenfone max.
And the worse part of this phone is battery  which ASUS are guaranteeing that it will last for more than 20hrs on continues use.
Only thing ASUS is very good at is the customization of UI.
but only cons are small length charger Dan every thing is fine ZenFone max is the top most mobile beds wen other phone is considered ill have heating problem but did don t I don t find heating problem while charging initially it was little heat but after 100  completely its fine  
Overall I would say Asus ZenFone Max is the best phone you can get under 10k.
Was confused between this and the redmi note 3. ultimately  brought this and totally Satisfied with Asus.
 Got Asus ZenFone Max under exchange offer for my old Asus ZenFone 5.
a phone within the range of 10000 the asus zenfone max is most admirable one with its outstanding battery 
--------------------------------------------------------
no heating  4
The market is currently saturated with octacore phones  super amoled displays and all other sort of battery draing features which may seem wonderful but over heating and energy shortage continue to be the deepest problems with them all.
Last but not the least   NO HEATING PROBLEM AT ALL  while charging and using .
Small heating will occur in talktime hours which is usual in smartphone  not an issue.
0  heating issue.

Camera   As a price of 10k it has an excellent rear and front camera with laser auto focus.
Good front cam
sound is okay  camera is too good both front and back 
A very good Front camera in 5MP segment but main camera a little low as compared to mi4i 13MP camera.
Front could have been better but it is overall good.
Camera  both front and rear very good.
The main thing which make me to love it more is its front   rear camera which is truly amazing.
--------------------------------------------------------

and lasts for 1 and half days nearly for non stop Internet usage   online gaming.
goes for two days with heavy gaming and video and music with constant internet via wifi or 3g  
Battery life is really good with internet continues use.
For 10K  there simply isnt another device currently in the market that can provide long internet surfing  pristine call quality  durable  even if slightly heavy  yet graceful body.
No heating issu while playing games or useing internet wifi 4g.
--------------------------------------------------------
at price range  3
at this price range it s the best.
At this price range its really good.
--------------------------------------------------------
hours to charge  3
After full charge I traveled 200 km by bus   used GPS for about 15 mins listen to music for at least 2 hour  watch videos for 15 mins  took around 30 photos about 30 mins talk about 10 mins   just swiped for at least 2 hours my battery shows 35   after 18 hours.
In an couple of hours   it may be able to only charge by 20.
 Sexy phone and awesome battery back up very big in size bigger than redmi note 4 but the only problem is with the processor very poor in performance it wont support big apps and often hangs apart from this every thing is superb minimum 9 hours usage on gaming  
3 to 3 and a half hours.
8 hours to full charge .
--------------------------------------------------------
to 3 days  -3
Unfortunately after 3 days of delivery   due to minor accident my phone LCD got damaged   I immediately submitted handset to authorized service center at Gurgaon  they assured me to rectify the same in 3 working days.
once i charge it its last up to 4 days with normal uses and 3 days with watching movies.
5 days after heavy usage and 2 to 3 days on normal usage  overvall good value for money 
Mine 3 days battery on lite heavy use 2 days exactly.
Battery Backup is good last 3 days.
Battery 5hr to charge 5000ma and last upto 3 days.

--------------------------------------------------------
nice speakers  3
Speaker is great.
Only single issue found volume of mobile speaker is too much low.
The speaker s sound comes stuck play stuck play when i play music or listening anything with mobile speaker or earphone.
--------------------------------------------------------
time to charge  -3
Only issue is it s taking vary long time to charge and speaker quality is poor.
no need to charge for 3 days with full time 4g working.
It takes a long time to charge but thats not a problem becaue your battery will last at least of 36.
Only issue I found till now is it takes time to charge and at the same time it gives good battery backup.
Only the problem is it slightly heavy due to the battery and it takes a long time to charge the battery almost 5 hrs.
I got this phone for a friend who doesnt get much time to charge the battery so end up with no power at crucial moments.
--------------------------------------------------------
gorilla glass  3
Make sure you ve installed a good tempered glass.
I overcome that with temper glass and a back case .
Gorilla glass proves not at all good .
Zenfone max has the latest Gorilla glass with one small fall it got cracks.
6. smooth touch gorilla glass 4  no need scratch card and Tempered Glass  
5 with HD display  CG glass 4 is good  and the viewing angles are also good.
NO Back cover  Tempered glass available yet as this phone has been recently launched so be VERY careful with the Big screen phone.
--------------------------------------------------------
pre loaded apps  -3
Some excellent and useful apps comes with Zen UI.
This mobile gives zen  Auto start manger  app to manage unwanted apps loaded into the RAM when we not using them.
 We can manage ram easily and clear ram using by other apps .
U can need to disable all unwanted apps from settings to save battery usage.
Unable to install apps of  50 Mb size.
Makers haven t preloaded the phone with many useless apps  and thanks to that.
1  zen UI installs lots of unwanted apps when u connect to internet for first time
Slight lagging in opening apps on 4th day.
Have installed or disable apps which i don t use often 
Some useless apps are pre instralled which u cant uninstrall  if unrooted 
--------------------------------------------------------

I was planning to get this mobile for a long time and finally got this last week.
In my first week  it took me 3 days to discharge the battery.
It hangs in the very first week  get warm while surfing net  battery is also not very long lasting as declared by the manufacturer.
i reported to flipkart last week  they said that they will send technical person to solve the issues once its manfactured issue the phone will replace.
Great value for money  good upgrade to battery life  using since last one week  find it smooth and uninterrupted  no heating issues till date  little heavy in weight but ok to manage.
I received this mobile last week.
Battery backup is extraordinary  for normal usage twice a week you have to charge  that s enough.
I am using it for last one week.

It was an worst phone ever I see it was hanging in first day itself I Wil return the phone in one day itself.
If you are internet savvy the its Best phone for you because it dont get discharge for one full day upon Full usage of net Continuously for 24hour.
Must have phone for people who want it see the other day without recharging.
 Best in class and what a perfect  one day delivery  service provided by flipkart .
Kindly don t buy this phone I just got this phone via flipkart a week before from the second day it started giving trouble 
lasts for 2 to 3 days easily with normal usage and one and a half day with heavy usage.
Best battery backup can last upto two days for normal use while other phone hardly touch second day.
 Lemme say  I am one of those heavy users calls almost non stop  data connected always more on the 3g networks and less on 4g   data sync on   auto brightness on  location on  calls and data on dual sim and average use of camera am a photographer    this MAX after fill charge say 8am gets me by till the second day till 11pm with 10  left i. e going through all the above mentioned.

4 days  -2
Finally I bought  Asus Zenfone 2 laser  4 days before i amazed with this performance and features.
2V DC   1 A does the job in about 4 hours which is pretty okay considering the juice it can deliver for next 2 days.
I m using this mobile last 15 days   I m giving 4 stats for its performance.
once i charge it its last up to 4 days with normal uses and 3 days with watching movies.
100 percent but it will be worth the wait because you can rest assured the device will last you for two whole days even with wifi  4G    over 10  hours of on screen time.
Good phone i got this phone within 4 days mobile battery is very good

--------------------------------------------------------

5 days after heavy usage and 2 to 3 days on normal usage  overvall good value for money 
--------------------------------------------------------
No hanging  1
I have ordered zenfone max and it had a constant hanging issue.
--------------------------------------------------------
a power bank  1
Best is its display  A good battery backup  Hell of a camera with laser focus  Feels better to hold and a heavy body to determine the internal power.
 For those of us who are not deeply obsessed with playing games but would rather be able to browse the net and read  watch videos  listen to songs and not have to worry about the phone heating up and dying due to power shortage  the Zenfone Max is the best choice.
 POWER packed mobile.
--------------------------------------------------------
2 gb ram  1
Out of 2 gb RAM you can easily get 1gb of RAM free all the time.
2GB RAM and 16 GB internal memory was sufficient for me 
 Ram is just 2 GB but what better we expect under 10k
well 2gb ram is quite enough for socializing .
--------------------------------------------------------
zenfone 2 laser  1
Feels a bit heavier than the usual zenfone 5 because of the 5000mAh battery.
Very good ZenFone customized USER INTERFACE.
The touch and feel of the phone has completely been revised from the previous zenfone 5.
I also use Asus Zenfone Lesar 2 its so good But Zenfone Max is Not.
 the product and service of the mobile zenfone bad .
I earlier has Asus Zenfone 5 which worked great.
rest features matches other zenfone series.
but only cons are small length charger Dan every thing is fine ZenFone max is the top most mobile beds wen other phone is considered ill have heating problem but did don t I don t find heating problem while charging initially it was little heat but after 100  completely its fine  
if this phone could achieve the processor speed of Zenfone 5  it has potential to become the next gen Super.
 Battery backup not good it s same like ZenFone 2 laser which has only 3000Mah battery whereas this phone has 5000mah disappointed a bit but overall phone is good 
--------------------------------------------------------
multi tasking  1

--------------------------------------------------------
waste of money  1
only good thing is battery otherwise waste mobile and loss of money 
--------------------------------------------------------
right choice  -1
But for selfie lovers and heavy gamers  Find some other smartphone as this will not be the right choice for you.
Its not the right choice for multi tasking.
then  this phone is just the right choice.
--------------------------------------------------------
thanks  -1
I d like to end this review with a note of sincere thanks to other reviewers who helped me decide to make this purchase and a kudos to Flipkart and WS Retail for promptly replacing the first device with a second and then diligently providing a refund when even the second device showed manufacturing defects pertaing to the sound system.
