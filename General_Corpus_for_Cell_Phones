 Material quality is better and look is awesome. Its corner are too much hurting on hand. 
Cons :
1) Display quality is too poor as aspect to Micromax.
2) Touch is not sensitive as in all modern phone under this budget. You feel liitle hard touch while typing.
3) Third class accessories provided by Micromax expect its charger. The earphone and charger cable are worst quality. 
4) Camera quality is bad. No such resolution describe by micromax.
5) Micromax needs to much improvement in its mobile UI. The quality of UI is also not good and hard to access and find app. 
Pros :
1) Fast accessible any app. No face any legging issue between app.
2) Good looking feel like rich phone. 
If you feel like you want good looking phone than must by it otherwise Redmi2 prime is better options for this price range. 
 First BIG thank to Flipkart for your fast delivery service,after i booked i got it on next day only i think i am the first person to booked and received this mobile.and late to post my review comments..I had gone thru the mobile verification and validation, I found some defects and I spoke to Flipkart customer care regarding this defect and finally returned the product.Budget wise OK with 2GB RAM.  
These are my honest reviews
Pro's:
-2GB RAM
-16GB memory
-4G support
-Carning Gorilla Glass 3 
Cons:
-Found sensor light NOT working
-Charger port is NOT supporting for other BRAND is the BIGGEST DEFECT i found because the port has very depth and other universal chargers are short length compare to micromax
-Poor camera Quality
-Poor Battery backup
-Poor Speaker & Voice call
-Heating problem while using internet
-Reduced processor features as compared to M Canvas Express 2 
-Bit heavy weight  
Compare to Express 2 this mobile has reduced features.Overall review if you don't look into features then go for it. 
I'm regular customer of Flipkart!!!!! 
 I brought this from flipkart. they delivered within 48 hours..i was amazed with the speedy delivery..overall the phone is very good in this budget.
processor, ram, and the sensor are quite decent. camera quality is average and im not happy about that... 
unable to hear the person who is using this phone..
cheap call quality... 
operating system is Android v5.1 (Lollipop)
its has very big screen and hd video players.with gorilla 3 glass.  
overall its a pretty good phone for normal user and it comes with tempered glass in the box... 
 it is a good device for me. very nice mobile in this budget...!
that's why iam choosing this mobile. iam suggest to all mobile lovers please select this mobile in low budget...! 
 very very cheap Quality mobile i ever seen. Please don't buy this phone. 
Cheap Quality 'Display'

Please don't go for this Mobile. 
 First BIG thank to Flipkart for your fast delivery service,
I think this is the only phone currently available at low price with higher specifications.   
 many people said about it's camera..its a very good phone..also in gaming..i give it 5 star............................................ 
 pros-good speed,good rear camera,2 gb ram
cons-front camera,battary back up
 over all i give 4 star................................. 
 I ordered this phone from flipkart and it was delivered before the delivery date. Happy for that. Most of the features are good in this phone but the main feature of camera is lacking somehow. And my main purpose was good camera. Not happy for that. It has big screen and looks stylish. 
 pros: 1. good display quality
 2. good internet connectivity
 3. good clearity
 4. rear camera is good
 5. 2GB RAM makes easy multi tasking
 6. smooth handaling
 7. value for money
inspite of this, there are some cons 
cons: 1. front camera is poor
 2. heating problem
 3. poor battery backup 
i suggest you, if you are rough user, dont buy this phone
but this is very affordable phone
if you have 6599.....please go and buy it 
(chinmay) 
 I have ordered this phone 3 days back and today I've received it.
Flipkart delivered it on the date before expected delivery.
Impressed with look and it's features.
I think this is the only phone currently available at low price with higher specifications. 
 please do not buy any product i bought this product and when ask one of customer care executive to replace my phone customer care executive even didn't listen to me. Problem with the handset when i watching movies online and surfing and put my phone on charge battery still draining again i recommend guys do not buy any product from this site for worse customer care .....rest of the things up to you.....thanks for poor service flipkart ...0star 
 Its a very bad mobile.. I will suggest never try to purchase this companies handset. its a wastage of money. 
 Apps are working smoothly but touch is kinda slow but its acceptable given the price range of this phone. Battery is also fine. Camera quality is also fine. After using it for a month I can say that its a good product at this price range. Working fine!  
Some problems that I faced: Glass cover that come with box had a crack but credit was added to my account to purchase the same so its fine. Also the silver strip that's on the side of phone had a cut in mine set and some portion of it was it cracked and come out after rubbing against my pocket. Thanks to flipkart for replacing it. So if you are purchasing this product, do check the side strip. Everything else is just fine. I will give it a 4 star (1 star less since touch is kinda slow). So if you are thinking whether to buy this product or not well I will say go for it! Its a good deal. 
 Good 4g phone in 6k.
Rear Camera is good.
Front camera is fine u can do Skype call if you have good light also u can take good picture if u are in good light.
good memory of 2gb ram, as it comes with preloaded apps also after that u will have 1.2 gb of ram free. so no hanging problem.
ear phone not good quality... will be damaged soon ,no long life for ear phones,
device gets heated up when its getting charged, also when you are making calls.
in standby time its ok . apart from this no heating problem.
can be xpandable upto 32 gb and internal memory is 16gb . so no space issue .
It may have an issue with earphone jack. because this is my replaced device. my previous device was having mic problem. 
So if buy it you will be having an issue with mic or earphone jack.
Battery backup is not good drain very fast. It drops down to 50 percent in 4 hours, it has only have 2000 mah, so your phone will only give backup of 1 day if u are not using for gaming and music. so u have to charge it every day. 
Over all good phone but very poor battery backup. 
 This is Good phone under this budget..
I think this is the only phone currently available at low price with higher specifications. i buy this phone only 5399 . Really big thanks FLIPKART .................. 
 Excellent product in this price. Call quality and net speed is good, you can utilize your 4g data properly. 
 In one word its awsme ..... Ekdm fatafati . Khub valo product . Khub joldi service . Joldi kine fela valo . 
 This is the best of the class mobile and it has good display. many people say that camera is bad it is due to the settings just adjust it and u will get good pictures. The battery is not the best but decent for normal usage without internet it stands for more than 24 hrs. If u have 6599 just buy it 
 nice product in such a cheap rate............. camera, processor and every thing is fine............good work Micromax.... 
 Excellent product. good response to touch. easy flipping from one app to another.good buy for the price offered. 
 Very nice. . Gud looking. ... gud feature.... only battery backbackup is less. 
 It is a very good phone at least for this price instead of going for the Samsung and phicomm phones.. Except the battery the phone is very good.. 
 Happy with product(Micromax Canvas Xpress 4G) and service...kept it up flipkart.... even i suggest to others 
 very very cheap Quality mobile i ever seen. Please don't buy this phone.

Worst Camera  
 Good 1, worthy, but my tampered glass was broken and flipkart filled my wallet with 200 bucks but still unable to get its screen guard or tampered glass. 
 Good mbile.. Bt selfie camera is not good..................... 
 Returned after 1 day use. Bad built quality, bad camera, no picture clarity. A bad product built by China 
 Please my mobile micromax canvas xpress 4g mobile phones delivery is good bt heating battery level low % 
 I am not happy with this phone, Display not good, Poor Sound Quality, not a good phone, 
Don't be fooled by the Micromax low price phone 
 The product is not up to the mark with the specification,  
Camera is so poor and sound quality is also not upto the mark.  
Please go for MI or Lenevo rather wasting money on this product.  
 Not a good phone.... camera quality is worst.. as if it is a VGA Camera... the Touch doesnt respond properly.... the only thing i like is the look of the phone... rest everything is not up to the mark.... Don't buy..... 
 Very poor quality of camera, if u want a good camera then dont go for it. Its look like VGA camera, delay in video recording, flash is very bad, one can use it for only flash light not for taking pics in low light. 
 I brought this from flipkart. timely delivery..overall the phone are very poor .phone can not perform well in one month ie. bettery problem, hearing problem , calling problem etc 
 i purchase micro-max canvas express 4g m not happy with this product camera quality is so bad its looks like 2 mp or VGA camera..I am not satisfy with this phone...hate this phone 
 the battery of this phone is not not good. not giving the backups any move. i need to charge phone twice a day....  
the front camera which is 2 mp. the quality is not good. bt over all the phone is awesome. great ram. and the processor.   
 Overall its a good mobile but i experience the same problem as mentioned by the previous users of battery exhaust very soon and set gets overheated rest all is good easy to operate with all applications etc. I recommend no loss buying this mobile. 
 The mobile has 2 gb ram and a good after all it is very low but it heats up other than all features are good   
 NYC phone I liked it.I purchased this phone for my friend he liked lot. 
 Nice phone. Battery dries soon. But can be controlled using clean master app. 
 Good product, extra-ordinary specifications, nice features, low priced from Micromax and quick service from Flipkart... 
 Good ram , 16 GB internal ,best features , camera quality is also best

 Good product high speed mobile. Very fast. In buget price. Camera quality is also good. 
 Good mobile for that price
Everything is fine 
All tge best to micromax 
 Superb I like it nice mobile with nice features but the drawback is battery 
 Super mobile with super specifications more functions with redmi2 prime 
 I am using since Feb-2016. sound and quality of voice calls is not that good. micormax spark that I had earlier was far better. Touch screen is in repair now. I have asked for replacement . they are still investigating and will can do it if company decides so or will keep trying it for repair. this may extend for 30days too. thumbs down. models lesser that this price range work better. 
 Good phone at this price..
Only problem with charging port it is not standardized so we have to use specific charger. 
 1. Heats a lot.
2. Battery is terribly bad. If connected through laptop for charging then charge actually decreases if you are using 3G hot spot for browsing simultaneously. I have never heard/experienced this ever.
3. Always need to carry a battery bank even if travelling for 4 hours. Very fast decrease in charge when 3G used.
4. Calling sound quality is average. Not comparable to any low or high quality mobile.
5. Only good thing - Design is cool. Handy and looks like a costlier mobile.
6. I got my money returned by flipkart for this.
7. You should never think of buying this phone. 
 Have been using this product for 04 months. No problem at all sleek, stylish and well finished product from Micro max & of course well packed and in time delivery from Flipkart. Though front camera not very good for selfie but in the price range its more than you can ask for. 
 its good no issues but camera is pathetic screen quality is ok ok processing is impressive do not play true hd 720p videos 
 This is a Value for Money Phone.... Great Specs in Such a low Price...... Also Khudos to Flipkart got it for 3000/- only with exchange offer.......  
please do not buy any product i bought this product. From 1st day i found below problems in phone. 
-Charger port is NOT supporting with Power Bank and Car Mobile Charger Port.
-Poor camera Quality
-Poor Battery backup
-Poor Speaker & Voice call
-Heating problem while using internet 
Battery is draining while charging also. Again i recommend guys do not buy any product from this product. Giving 1 Star for flipkart fast delivery not for product.  
 Good product in this price........Unbelievable Price with more configuration like 4g enabled...2 gb RAM & 16 GB internal... 
 phone is good in look but there is heating proble while i talking, battery backup is not good, 
but in this price phone is good.. 
 The looks of the phone is very good. It is slim. Touch is also good. Camera also good. but some heating problem on handset. otherwise it is a very good phone on this price. 
 Good phone with very good display thanks for micromax making very good phone and trying upgrade their quality also this is good thing 
 micromax canvas xpress 4G is looking good.but picture quality is not too good.and rear camera quality is too poor.tuch of down button so heard,and not seen in night.other features in this price good.battery backup not long time. everyday charging battery.audio quality is good for listen music.video quality is poor,not hd. i hope my truly reviews help other people purchase this item.
i am not happy this time of flipkart delivery. 3 days late delivery my products as per given delivery date at the booking time. 
 phone is jst amage wid its features and design is also sleeky nd slim.only drawback with dis device is that poor bttry back up.thinks up dis will fixed at marshmallow update 
 It's a good phone at budget point of view but little bit both camera is poor......... 
Except camera this phone is too good in looking, handling, processing. 
 Not worth, battery backup will be 2-3 hrs only. Poor battery back-up, camera quality is also not up to dmark. I m not happy with this Micromax Canvas Xpress 4G 
 The phone itself isnt that bad, but with other competitors in the market you will get a much better phone in same range. The phone is extremely slow, hard touchscreen (to the point you have to actually hit it), fairly cheap exterior and rough edges. Wont recommend this to potential buyers 
 worst battery....i've ever had....in a phone. you have to charge it twice a day for.....regular use and...if you use it continuously for half an hour......it gets hot....and its impossible for one to hold it.... the corners are also very sharp......pricks when kept in the jeans pocket. 
 I am also facing Heating problem while using internet.....its good to buy and use 
anyway set is good 
 Phone is excellent. 
I purchased from flipcart. 
Headphone is not working. 
 Very Good Phone by Micromax. and its a very cheap and best 4G phone at this price Range.
camera is ok ok
2 GB Ram is enough 
bt the isuue is with Battery 
its not suitble for that feature phone 
 Hi... 
 Friends this product is very useful but this process was very late & use 4g system was hanging so please select right item to use 4g . 
 Thanking you 
 Since i opened the box...and used camera for first tym, camera issues started, screen started showing different coloured lines...but i must say that flipkart's work is amazing....easy return policy works really good..and return pickup was so quick...best customer satisfaction i experinced till day...! Thank you flipkart. 
 This phone is just perfect wow, Nic pakage i really love this phone plus the warenty card is perfect thanks to flipkart 
 I purchase 3 sets for my 3 different friend. Receive feedback from them as set is overall performance is good in this price range. touch is little bit slow. All others normally ok. 
 Material quality is better and look is awesome. Its corner are too much hurting on hand. 
Cons :
1) Display quality is too poor as aspect to Micromax.
2) Touch is not sensitive as in all modern phone under this budget. You feel liitle hard touch while typing.
3) Third class accessories provided by Micromax expect its charger. The earphone and charger cable are worst quality. 
4) Camera quality is bad. No such resolution describe by micromax.
5) Micromax needs to much improvement in its mobile UI. The quality of UI is also not good and hard to access and find app. 
Pros :
1) Fast accessible any app. No face any legging issue between app.
2) Good looking feel like rich phone. 
If you feel like you want good looking phone than must by it otherwise Redmi2 prime is better options for this price range. 
 Material quality is better and look is good. 
Cons :
1) Display quality is too poor as aspect to Micromax.
2) Accessories provided are of too low quality. The earphone doesn't work properly. 
3) Camera quality is bad. 
4) Music player doesn't even work at all.
5) Phone book and contacts doesn't get loaded properly once you unlock the phone. So can't make calls or messages either. 
Pros :
1) Good looking feel like rich phone. 
If you feel like you want good looking phone then Redmi2 prime and Coolpad Note Lite are better options for this price range. 
Please don't go for this Mobile. 
 VERY VERY BAD BATTERY... AND MOTHER BOARD. 
BATTERY WAS DRY AND PROBLEM WITH IN ONE WEEK. 
SERVICE CENTER VERY BAD EXPERIENCE 
 both the camara not good battery is also not good 
egdes are also not good so that not easy to handle it 
heating problem when use thats also problem yet  
Charger port is NOT supporting for other BRAND 
Poor Battery backup A BIG PROBLEM
Poor Speaker & INCOMING CLEAR VOICE CALL
VERY Poor camera Quality  
 Dear All, 
The handset packs quite a few features in the box but still needs to improve the consumer experience and value of money. the battery is on the inferior side.  
Regards, 
Manas Saha 
 The Product is Good in the price. Can't expect more. Feel Good to see Made In India. 
Feedback - Phone heats up little bit. 
 build quality is not as good as expected. Camera is good. charging takes too much time.earphone and data cables are below average. 
 This Phone is good..... Good phone under this budget I brought this from flipkart. they delivered within 38 hours. 
 MOBILE PHONE IS 4G LIKE THIS PRICE IS OK. BUT THE MOBILE IS OVER HEAT USING OVER CALL TO ANYONE. USING LIKE 4G AND OTHER FEATURE IS GOOD. 
 worst part of this mobile is battery.very inconsistent battery performance.other things was good.timely delivered by the seller.other things was good............................. 
 touch gone in 2 months. after complaining, they charged me with 2000 rs for new touch screen. please note phone was still under warranty 
 best phone in this price range, stock android and internal 16GB Ram, will never let you down with installation of apps
go for it 
cons: battery life
bottom line: best in this price range, if battery is your concern then buy a power bank,you will never complain again 
 Good looking...... Better price for 4g set ..
Camera quality; I think not so good.
Good ram....sim card offer is great (Airtel) 
 operating is easy camera resolution is good.weight less heat also very low.operating is easy camera resolution is good.weight less heat also very low  
 Dull camera experience both front and back....and also wasn't able to detect my sim cards... 
 this phone is totaly loss of money.
More heating after 10-20 mins uses internet, games etc.
very bad charger and earphone.
And important thing is that its battery backup very low.
If you want to only call then buy this phone. 
 Features at this price range is very good. Working very well after 2 months. Though its not for higher end gaming. 
 mobile is getting heated very often!!!!!!!! 
Touch was not good at all . 
price is very attractive to buy however i suggest to go for any other brand which is in same price 
 i am using the phone more than 6 months.it is very bad qulity especally when you are calling..donot buy this phone 
 1.mobile is good but it is not supporting otg . 
2.the battery backup is very poor.
3.in sunlight the te display is not seen clearly 
 Great Mobile in this price though photo quality is not so good, but for this range seems to be ok. battery back is up to the mark. i ca recommend is this phone for the basic users. 
 5 star because value for money. Network can be selected specific only 3g only 4g only 2g and highest connection 4g, which is helpful in Indian conditions 
 This is good phone in optimum budget. one should purchase this phone. very good application and storage capacity. 
 there is several problems in  
(Basically i am a big fan of micro max but i am struggling with following problems) set was new purchased on 18.01.16 
1) No battery backup (Max 2 Hr when switch on net) 
 2) Speaker not good 
3) huge heat when switch on net within in 10 min 
 Looking good but the receiver microphone is not working well. Audio quality is low... Otherwise rest of all functionality are working well.. Not good as expectation. 
 Is a super super super phone.. its give 3g speed in 2g mode...wow what a phone...thanku flipkart 
 smart looking... bur sensor is not working... earphone stupid quality.. besides these every thing is good...... 
 Camera qulity is pathatic dear micromax 
please improve, in same rate segment others are getting better, as you are an indian brand of mobiles, please loook in to quality 
 Micromax phones are just a shit. poor quality product in terms of performance and battery backup.only plus is its appearance. of course it looks slim. for that reason alone i bought this phone. the phone was defective. it has some software problem till now. i am not able to read my contacts. it automatically deletes the contact list and clears the call log. you cant even take the missed calls list. i tried downloading call log and contacts app from google store. still, the problem persists. it heats up while using internet. battery backup is very poor. it drains from 100 - 0 % within two hours if you use internet or watch videos. i requested for replacement as soon as i received my product. they cancelled the return request. they called me told me to do some bull shit that didnt work out. i requested again. they cancelled again. i still face the problem. it is one of the worst phones i ve ever used. my personal advise to you is dont buy micromax products. its just waste of money. micromax is the poorest phone brand on earth. f em. 
 Nice Phone but slowly charged and betery heat early while internet On 
 Best mobile for its price. 2GB RAM, 16GB Internal memory & 4G is advantageous i guess. Appears like mobile gets heated up soon may be because of 1GHz CPU. Touch screen wont work some times have to wait for 2 to 5 seconds and then tap. Appears like battery drains fast & charging takes little longer time. Compared to my previous mobile (2G, 2GB internal memory, 512 MB RAM), really enjoyed using Micromax Q413 and continue to enjoy another 1 and half year. Flipkart's Fast delivery is good. 
 don't buy
surprising it have 4 mp back and 1 mp front cam
at add and on product specification it show 8 mp but in setting it have option only 4 mp 
 i give u 1star because not avilable in 0star not batary bacup camera is 5 pixel but working same like 2 pixel 
 1.ABS plastic use very rough.
2.Phone corner are damages automatically.
3.Hang problem also.
4. looking good but material is very bad.
5. Battery is not good also 
 please don't buy this worst phone ever from micromax phone heats up and battery drains quickly and camera looks like a VGA worst front and rear camera plz don't waste your money 
 The mobile looks good in terms of features offered. The screen guard which came in the package was already broken 
 *very worst phone all micromax phones.
*phone is very heat at the time of charging and calling(above 100 degrees).
*very slow charging(100% full charging time taking upto 6 hours).
*camera clarity very worst(morning time photos are very worst night time some better).
*screen clarity is very worst. 
 All specifications are good but it's not supported otg cable 
 Speed not good, comparing with other 1 ghz +2GB RAM devise 
Touch sensitivity very poor
Battery very very Poor
NOT UP TO MARK, according to price   
 Sound quality very poor, touch not working proper, sound to other receivers not receiving good quality, 
Please don't purchase this phone 
 everything is good,except battery backup,
and touch does'nt work proper,when connected to charging,
and very slow charger.
rest everything is good performance wise. 
 Hi, I have bought this mobile through flipcart. My observation is as follows: 
1. Speaker quality is very Bad. Voice is not audible.
2. Battery performance is very poor. Draining very fast and taking very long time for recharge.
3. There is also heating issue with this phone.
4. Display and speed is average.
5.Ranking Average, 3.5/10.

 This phone is not good at all. Dont buy it due to budget. The phone has
1. Very poor speaker quality
2. Poor camera
3. Heating Problem
4. Low battery backup
5. And it does not support VoLTE 
 Micromax Canvas Xpress 4G-- Excellent Product , lolipop too good to use and as usual fast delivery service from flipkart.  
 very good screen
sound good
performance good
touch good responsibility
and model deigned like a costly handset  
only battery is bed 
 Fourth day from the delivery and usage, inserted the sd memory card and thereafter KAPUT, the phone never came alive. The phone power did not come at all despite having removed the SD memory card, had put the phone on charge for 10hrs and tried again, but everything went in vain. Bitter experience with Micromax and was compelled to return the product. Its better Micromax should look after QA issues of their products. I wanted to buy an 'Indian Smart phone' but failed in the first attempt itself. 
 Sound Quality very bad, noise, cant hear other person speaking, battery is very very poor, takes too long to get charged and gets instantly discharged, horrible mobile phone.
Features provided seems ok, speed is good, not very user friendly. 
 Touch is fine..screen size is gud..speaker volume is fine & the phones looks good but it has the worst camera both rear n front..flash isn't at all good..i preferred it ovr redmi prime 2 but now i regret and m facing a lot of probs during calls as the voic is not at all pleasant to ears nd it has becom impossible to talk on phon calls..
#do_not_buy!!
Micromax will always be micromax.. yuckk!!? 
 Be yourself. Be informative.
Let your personality shine through. But its equally important to provide facts to backup your opin 
 Very poor battery back-up, after charging mic doesn't responds I have to re-boot phone.
over all without battery back-up phone is usless. 
 It will have 2gb ram but when u go to play adio using Google play or other audio player it will start hanging. Once it will hang then u have switch off &on phone or give it to reboot . 
 I like This phone very much .It is A good phone with good camera and budget phone. It has good performance for gaming multi tasking.  
 Very nice slim products new 4G mobile price low good better the mobile ðÂ?Â?± 
 It is Amazing. Versatile features, latest Android operating system, stylish and attractive look & very cheap price makes it Ultimate. Handset containing 2GB RAM and 16GB internal memory made faster performance. 
 THIS PRODUCT IS AWESOME.....SET MAI KOI BHI PRBLM NHI HAI.....ITNE MAI SAB KUCH DE RHA HAI LE LO YR..........SAMSUNG IS NOTHING AS COMPARE TO THIS 
 I had purchased the product for my friend. He seems to be happy, but the battery does not stand more than 4-5 hours. Why do we call it as smart phones when these phones does not have capacity to work for an hour also. 
From Ram Bahadur, CMR IT.

 I am happy to purchase from flipcar.but I think that I purchase from flipcart some expectation. specially from you that some gift or discount from you.I don't aspect in cash.but some memories from you that fill that I purchase some thing than I got this memories thing.for all my life I memories. And give you promised that I never forgets. That memories and I never throne or sell it.thank you to give me a chance to give review to you.thank you very much& happy new year to you and all staff of flipcart. 
 i will not say it's very good Phone, even it's good in this budget i got 4G,5inchHD Screen,
2GB RAM/16GB ROM,8MP Primary, 2 MP Front, its a very good phone you can go for it.... 
 It was a perfect selection of smartphone. Good quality product at most reasonable price. Keep it Micromax. 
 UNDER THIS RANGE VERY GOOD PHONE I M USING THIS LAST WEEK EVERTHING IS PERFECT PROB. ONLY THIS IS NOT SUPPORT OTG 
 For this price configuration is good
Battery backup is poor and it takes long time for charging.
Ear phone and charger are third class and gives a feel of pure Chinese mobile. 
 Very Good Performance with this Budget.Looking at the specs, makes me want to buy this phone, but i am pretty sure i will need to hook it up to the charger after 1-3 hours of usage, the most common issue I have had with all smartphones. Still, the everything else is POSITIVELY 4 star for the Rs7000 price tag, > processor + ram should ideally be ok to play almost all the games with a fair amount of occasional lag. > dual sim, not a huge fan, still in todays world we want more so will do > 16gb , again very good storage, you would eventually have 11 gb to of actual usage i bet, just guessing > selfy freaky? not me but the specs look ok for a an average selfy freak, just dont zoom and reveal your pimples :P > excellent display overall, if you arent gonna play games for 1-2 hours straight, i think you might want to buy this bugger. 
 I bought this phone for my brother. He is keep on complaining about this mobile for over heating with less usage. 
 Low budget , value for money Mobile. Display is good but is camera average. Hands-free received with the mobile is not good.Nice for light users only. 
Delivery was under 4 days , nice surprise for first time from Flipkart !!!! 
 size, screen, touch, ... all are OK, but battery backup was very very bad..... 
i recharged twice the day.... without power bank could not use this phone....... 
 quality too much bandal and system processor pure battery uses very low, camera quality front and back side both poor very poor.
i am suggested frnds not purchase this mobile,...... am frusted..... 
 I was impressed by appearance and specification's of the phone
But when I started using it I found it was not up to mark
First problem was phone is getting over heating while charging
Secondly while using it was hanging up 
 ITS GOOD 
NICE PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE 
NOT HANGING
BATTERY LIFE IS AVERAGE
ANDROID LATEST VERSION
GAMING PERFORMANCES IS GOOD
3 STAR MOBILE  
 too much trobleshooting in phone during traveling or playing games too slow procesor and touch.front camera big zero megapixle primary also like vga.at the end wastage of money. 
 camera picture quality, battery backup is not much as expected, local 3rd class headphone, programs are auto running in background. 5/10, compass hardware not available, memory card not supporting. 
 I m not satisfy with Micromax Canvas Xpress 4G looking .ear phone are simple and old luking s comparing to the phone and technology
edges of phone are outside just like that phone is broken.speed nd clarity is good size is good.  
 The phone is very good looking, sleek and elegant. Much better than Redmi 2, lenovo or Yuphoria as far a looks are concerned. handling is also good.  
The item get delivered quickly by flipkart. I received the item in less then three days, though I reside far from the any of the big cities. 
 Value for money 
Camera not good in low light
Bettry not enough for whole day 
 I brought this for my wife, I was looking for some modern phone @ low cost, and its up to the mark to meet my expectation. 
Lookwise its good,ladies will like it :)
Smooth handling & good touch sensitivity
Comes with in box tempered glass
Camera is Okey.. Images taken @ night are not so clear feels like low camera quality. but if you takes photos in day light its Good quality,
Display is great & has modern looks, very sleek & stylish.   
 All specification vise good product
Camera good ,music average ,but most of the that this mobile support 4g with a low range mobile. And it have good looking and flat piece 
 Product better but camera is poor sound also and back cover is not sold this model I search every shop I need back cover 
Ringing volume is decrease  
 the phone is overal good .. every thing is ok in this price but the battery performace is very poor ......so think before u buy it 
 It is not a good phone. has wi-fi issue . I will not recommend this phone to anyone. Display quality not so good 
 In less than 2 months, battery gets discharged very fast. I haven't even used this phone very much !
Other things are OK with this phone. But the battery .......!!! 
I can't even find where to buy a replacement battery........ Not happy with Micromax at all. 
 Mobile is good but not fullfiled expectations battery power is very low , I've to recharge my mobile 20 times a day. Need to work on battery & quality of the mobile to fullfill customer expectations. 
 I have order micromax canvas xpress 4G from flipkart but they have delivery me himalaya baby shampo bottle ðð 
 Back panel is very low quality and battery backup is very poor 
 Not Good at all.. I was thinking to return the mobile but changed my mind. Battery backup is very low, it used to stay only 3-4 hour when i use net and take more than 2 hour to charge. Touch is very slow if you play game and mobile is getting hang if you don't remove background pages. Request you not to purchase this phone other wise you have to change your phone within 1 month. 
 Purchased this mobile through Ws Retail . Gifted it to my mother in law. Mobil gets terribly overheated. Despite the 30day flipkart policy which is there in this case, they are not ready to accept. On top they want customers to do trials as they say. Very bad.  
Never ever believe in Ws Retail. Cheats, bloody hell. Poor show from flipkart. 
 Currently my wallet has no bal so its not showing the wallet payment options when it will show me? 
 mb are gud but software problem n heating problem camera is bad

 Touch is not working properly... guys dont prefer this phone.... 
Among all the other micromax phone it is the dumbest phone... touch sensor is not working properly.... rly upset after getting this product... Battery capacity is also not that much good.

1. heating problem
2. sensor problem
3. battery problem

 I bought this phone, due to my friend brother was used this phone but that is good .
I bought this her suggestion, I used for 20 days, before i don't know ring tones were different for different SIM. One day I got phone for SIM 2 and I have selected 2 different ring tones for 2 sims. Surprise I got same ringtone for SIM 1 and Sim 2. after resetting I got SIM 2 ringtone for both sim 1 and 2. Such a worst phone.
don't choose this phone. I lost my hope on online. I never purchase anything in online:-((((( 
 i bought this mobile on 9th march but battery is heats too much and yesterday mobile was switched of automatically and battery also dead. now i am checking for return but return period is expired like that i getting answer. My 6000 rs only used for these 43 days. 
i am not satisfied with this. very very worst service. 
actually for this i dont want to give even single star. 
 i have replacement done for the new phone, since it came with defective battery and unable to fit the battery and hence i returned the phone. 
The phone replacement was done, but after inserting the battery the phone turned ON but unable to proceed with initial setup of the phone,touch features not responding.The phone back side was getting heated /warmer .The battery was getting heated up the moment i turned ON the phone. 
Very much disappointed.  
Very bad quality.the features are good,unable to use and check ,since phone was getting heated/warmer.   
 Dear All

Reason : We were unable to contact you for clarification.Please visit contact us to reopen the request like this they treat the customer after the purchase the items. 
 Basavaraj 
 Phone gets heated only in few mins. I gifted this to my sister and when I raised a request to return it only in 2 days, flipkart started sending e-mails related to debug. When I said that I don't want to debug the problem, I just want to return the product, flipkart rejected my request. Looks like they sold it to get rid of it and now they are not ready to take it back. 
"Flipkart Advantage" logo does not have any meaning. They are cheaters and their return process is full of hassles and moreover this they do not want to take returns. 
I HATE FLIPKART!! I can't even give rating 1 for this product, putting 1 just because it is mandatory. 
 Seriously not worth for voice calls. 
I got faulty accessories too. 
 very bad phone, bad camera, very very bad battery, if u trust me pls dnt buy, in this range there are many good phone are available .. again dont buy...thnxx 
 Mobile speaker is a very bad quality.It is replaced me but again the same proble with handset. and Flipkart team is also not good. 
 In the use of just 3 months, the phone has stopped working. Its speaker are not working. 2 times went to the Micromax repair center. But not given a permanent solution.
Very bad on part of Micromax. 
Please do not buy this model. Not worth the amount spent.
Strong NO to Micromax.   
 Nice phone in low budget
good hardware specifications
impressed with Flipkart delivery system 
nice great Phone 
 Performance is very poor. Data connectivity, voice call sound quality and battery backup is worst even bad than 1000 Rs mobile. 
 Good phone in range of 6000 .....i got it only in 6000.. Best fot rhis range 
 VERY BADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 
 product and flipkart is best but... ekart logistic is extremely very very very bad irritating courier 
 Performance and display is good but sound quality is very poor. 
 Poor battery backup. 4g not supporting in airtel network. Takes very longtime to power charge disappointed. 
 COSTLY & LIGHT WEIGTH IRON BOX.. RETAILER WONT TAKE BACK.. CUSSTOMER CARE WILL NOT RESPOND CORRECTLY.. 
 camera is at all good. battery life is not good most probablya bad product to buy.the phone is getting hang.camera quality is worst than ever. 
 Very disappointed from this set. Just buy some pain killer and medicines for Blood Pressure control first and only after that You will purchase this one. Its a complete example for waste of money and peace of mind to purchase a micromax mobiles. My rating is anything between -5. 
 both of my moible's sim slots are not working whereas,my sim is working properly with other mobiles...I get the this mobile on 14th January 2016,please help me out 
 Do not buy this phone. Worst battery back up and worst touch... 
 worst phone don't buy this type of phones.camera clarity very poor, everything okay,but this price compare other company phones is too best 
 As per requirement of 4g phone, this is budget phone and excellent working. I have no complain for this phone. Thanks to flipkart team.    
This phone is not a satisfied phone this for a average use using after one month this phone is hang up to several time and heating issue is another problem camera is not good 
 This is good phone but in this phone network connectivity issue. It is not connecting with network without reboot. 
 Been using the handset for the last 4 days. Not satisfied with the product performance. Even with a 2GB RAM, the response is very slow. Abnormal heating. Videos especially whattsapp files are not compatible that gets stuck up every second. Asked Flipkart to refund the money to which they gave some troubleshooting tips. The problems is still there even after following all the troubleshooting steps. Now I have asked for the handset replacement. Yet to receive any response from Flipkart team. Its just a waste of money and time. Pretty disgusting product and user interface. Camera quality very poor. 
Not worth spending on this brand. 
If anybody facing the same issue please respond!!! 
 The phone is battery backup is very bad 2hours . heavy heating mobile data mode . some time mic not working 
 Cheap Quality Product . Mobile Dead in 30 days ........... Poor service by Micromax............................................................................................................  
 this product has manufacturing defect and not recommended to other this mobile has many issue. but other micro max mobile is very good. 
 Please not purchase this device, touch not working properly . Most of time hang while no data in device . 
 Please dont buy this phone.. 
This phone has very poor sound quality , Camera quality is very very very poor.
Other party voice is not clear and speaker phone voice is also not clear.  
Battery is not even comes for 4 hrs .. Its a waste phone...Please dont waste your money !! You can get very good phone with other brands.. 
 Don't Ever Try To Buy, Waste Of Money, Shit Is Better. Micromax Sucks To The Core. Flipkart Sucks Too 
 4g mobile at such an small price........... i think this mobile is value for all.....................................................................................................................................................................................  
FIRST THANK YOU TO FLIPKART FOR PROVIDING THIS MOBILE IN THEIR KART 
NICE DISPLAY
NICE CAMERA QUALITY
CHEAP AND BEST MOBILE
CAN BUY IT CONFIDENCLY 
 Very dirty and so bad mobile hang and very slow process i have this mobile only 1month destroy 
 Browser,speed, display everything is dull in this phone. Not worth buying.
There are several options out there. But no this one!! 
 This mobile looks value for money but it is not durable. After two weeks it switched off abruptly and is dead. I thought it might be a one off and got a replacement from Flipkart. To my surprise the new piece is dead on the second day. I have now asked for refund. Better don't go for this mobile. 
 CONFIGURATION NOT GOOD, CAMERA IS NOT PROPERLY VISIBLE. ZOOM NOT WORKING. IF YOU BUY YOU WILL SURE LOSS. 
 Mobile main things are speaker and Camera.camera its not an big issue but the speaker irritating us,,someone kindly advise me can i change into good speaker @micro max service center and how long it takes time to replace.plzzz 
 I received Micromax Canvas Xpress 4G from Flipkart on 17 Feb 2016. The mobile has problem with the Phone speakers. Flipkart has rejected my request to replace. The problem is not yet solved as I have received a defective piece. 
My request to Flipkart is get the problem resolved and don't be so irresponsible. 
 This mobile was very bad battery and no notification light on and so very very bad camera quality please refund my money or change mobile please.... 
 i had purchased this phone. phone specialization is good but i found duplicate accessories and some defect phone. so i think vendor is not sell good product. 
 Phone is good but it had a vry bad heating and backup problem 
I have purchsed this phone twice but I faced same problem both the time 
1st tym i purchased it nd after charging it full battery becomes low vry fast without use so I returned it
After sometime I purchased same phone it started hanging within 4-5 hrs of use and backup problem was same after charge fully it gets low very fast so i again returned it 
But the phone is good   
 Micromax mobile phones are the worst phone and has the worst servicing I have ever seen in my life. I have purchased recently a Micromax express 4G.Used for just one month...I had very bad experience with phone and its service centre. Could you believe...I have paid 1300rs for repairing my new cell phone just 2 days ago(18/2/2016)..bt still my cell phone was not repaired…Since the service was third class, I found some body parts were missing…. they are not giving money back for missing parts or not checking camera for verification purpose…I have mailed ,called customer care and went service centre many times bt they were not listening to my queries… its just like.. they don’t care about customers… they are making customers fool and doing cheap activity just sack of 500rs… 
i request u all those who are planning to buy a mobile phone or a smart phone..Please please please please…don’t buy micromax otherwise u will regret just like me  
 camera quality is poor. both front and back
normal charger cannot be used for this mobile as the width of its charging point is more.
signal getting disconnected. i am using idea 4g sim. tried both sim slots but still the signal of mobile is being disconnected after switching on the phone after 5 mins.
not recommended 
 taking long time to charge, but flipkart's service is good, they gave me a new phone when i returned. even the new phone has some problem, its heating automatically, when we use one or two apps for more thatn 5 to 7 minutes.
i bought three phones on the same day, there are many problem in teh other two also, only one out of 3 is goot in battery backup, the other two are discharging quickly. 
 mobile condition is very bad. Andriod correpted with 21 virus. It respond vrey slow .............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 
 Many times sound from this side does not go during call to other side. Battery discharge fastly it's backup is not good like 2000mAH....................................................... 
 Worst product i had ever buyed, the build quality is very poor. so dont buy this product.
And there is no service center in kochi. when i called the flipcart CC they give the micro max service center detail in kochi, and i went to check the phone at the service center they told me that they cant repair the phone because they are not aware of this product. 
 I purchased this phone last month. 
Till 35 days no issues. But after that in a day touch screen and battery problem  
Lot of issue in phone so... Please don't purchase 
 Last week, I bought Micromax canvas Xpress 4g from flipkart.com
This phone contains too much problems with respect to selling price. 
Camera- On the box, 8MP camera is mention. But, it's picture clarity is less than my old Nokia C2 having 3.2MP camera. If you are selling phone at ?7k then you should work on at least rear camera section. The front selfie camera provide with phone is useless. No one like to use such quality of pictures. Both camera provide with this phone are worst. Seriously i am very disappoint due to such quality of hardware provide by you at cost of ?7k. 
USB cord- The USB cord provide with charger is also very cheep quality. Plastic material use for that cord is low grade. It's micro port is also fits very loose with given mobile. 
Speakers- The loudness of speakers is very shameful. The phones selling at ?2-3k are more loud and clear sound than this phone. 
Please give me replacement with better quality of phone. 
 battery backup is not good ..too much heating from 1st day. 100% showing after 5min 80% ...poor quality. 
 i browt micromax mobile that mobile will not swich on pls i want to exchange of my mobile to samsung mobile pls reply me to my request 
 is there notification LED lights are in this phone???is it work proper???
i bought from flipkart 2 week ago i tried many apps to test LED(notification not flahs light)
but its not blinking for a while.
so i want to know that this feature is in this phone or not???? 
why there is too much heating of screen!!!charging after hibernating also gives hot screen!!!!!during normal use no games no video than also heating!!!!!!very cheap hardware used in this phone worst phone writing after 4 month of user experience !!!!this is why brand india(made in india) has no value in international market.other brands are too good at this price with same features!!!!!!my advice is don't buy this product nothing is satisfactory except look,which is not primary objective of any user. 
 NOT USEFULY,DEAR ALL GUYS PLEASE DON't BUY IT,MANY PROBLEMS IN HERE,MOST- SPEAK & HEAR SOUND PROBLEMATICs, MY EXPE WISE- THIS MOBILE HANDSET IS TOTALY WEAK & ROUGH.................. 
 Wast product I have taken mobile on Jan 14 and after that I return the product because of battery issue and I ordered again same product and the issue was same with new product flipkart is selling duplicate product don't order in flipkart 
 The mobile gets discharge early. Heating problem is regular. Dont buy these mobile atall. They r not giving replacement or Refund. This time i failed from u flipcart. 2 times they called but the mobile problem is little bit 20% less. But i dont want replacement for these. I want my Refund. 
 The mobile was good, but inside the box tempered screen guard was cracked on delivery. i report the damage issue to flipkart. i asked to flipkart for replace the damaged screen guard. but they are rejected my replacement request. i can't accept this. very very disappointment on flipkart poor delivery and customer care service. please don't buy anything throught flipkart.

Worst Camera 
 This is my last purchase for sure from flipkart. This particular product I bought is a crap. Sellers registered with flipkart are frauds. Flip kart just busy in making money and not concern about their clients. CEO is sleeping somewhere . product is crap and customer care service is worse than ever and its getting worse day by day. I placed a order for this crap phone on 18 DEC through credit card .later on after receiving the phone,found its camera is a shit. So gone through a troubleshoot process with customer care technical team. I packed the phone as it is and returned this crap after a couple of days through dtdc courier . I have not mentioned any return or order I'd,as I have not been intimated by customer care executive. He simply asked me to return the product to warehouse at mahipalpur Delhi. I did courier that and since than I have been following through mails and phone calls.shit customer care executive every time ask for 24 hour and than 24 hour. This 24 hour story kept on for a week. Than I have been told your funds are under process and would receive in a week. Than after a week some customer care executive told me that your.product has been returned due to not mentioning return I'd and order I'd. And since than I m waiting for that parcel but have not received yet. I tried to track it and found dispatched from Delhi mahipalpur on 31 December. 
So flipkart has a poor customer care support.
Poor sellers registered .
Poor courier vendors registered. 
CEO and other management enjoying new year at home I guess.  
If any of supervisor or senior authority find this review ,than take action on this as I have already been harassed for my mistake ,that I purchased a phone through flip kart. Ultimately you are the people who are responsible for l this trouble . 
 not able to connect to pc using usb not more then 2 min you should be fast as 4g to operate it as the name suggest.
donot buy it as the service center people will...firki lege tumhari 
 i have raise a compalint in Flipkart in last month still its in process and now they are asking they dont have records abt my complaints  
even i called many times but again and again they are denying my request 
so i m very unsatishfy with Flipkart policies 
Even i wish say they want to sell only & does not matter images in market of Flipkart 
from today onwards i promiss i will not purchase any single item from Flipkart  
 I bought this phone in November end, it worked fine only for 10 days. After that it started giving trouble with the touch. Lower left hand corner is not sensitive at all. No touch sensitivity there. Even though it claimed as gorilla glass, screen cracked after falling from the coffee table. Please dont buy this. 
 I purchase 1st time a product by flipkart. and i am happy with my micromax canvas xpress 4g Q413 handset. 
this mobile is very good working and flipkart packaging is very nice.
flipkart give with this product a screengaurd but i dont get this and i call coustmer care and his solved my problem and give me Rs. 120 refund price screenguard.
the micromax this mobile is very good working and no problem.the phone camera is week but this range this product is nice.
thaks flipkart 
 battery back up very poor

 a am old customer of flipkart but thid time i am getting worst service from the company. if possiable pls return my fund so that i am purchase new one becoz on of flipkart executive advice me to recharge a new internet pack but after recharge internet pack whatever step he advice me to follow all are not getting usefull,my phone battery is not stay any more. as per his commentment he told me that if this process is not working the flipkart company will refund my fund there after one of flipkart executive called me and asked me to download the smart check so they can check and try to resolve the issue but after checking through smart check problem is not solve.But the main concern is that till now no phone calls flipkart companyend to refund my amount, i am really very surprise to see that they have dont any responsibility for their customer and their product. 
So this bad and worst experience from FLIPKART company is teach me to keep safe distance from this company bcoz i dont expect this kind of service from FLIPKART like company.    
 Excellent service from flipkart.i got the product within 48 hours of order placement.Amazing product delivery.excellent packing the device reaches you safe in hand....I thnk they are best in delivering the product in short span f time with desired quality....GREAT WORK FLIPKART.WE ARE FAN OF YOU...............................you can buy this device.. a trustworthy product at reasonable price................................................. 
 very cheap quality product.after 2 or 3 days it switch off automatically anytime.....sometime battery down 70% to 15%  
 This phone's features and price looks so perfect but trust me it heats up like anything.. at times while making phone call my cheeks and ears become red, apart from the fact its battery drains very fast.. Its gonna be your wrong choice of buying it... MyD! 
 I ordered the ph.. It is an awesome set.. It was very well packed and very fast delivered to me.. Im loving the phone.. Itz lovely to hang out with.. 
 broken Screen Guard found in the box. Otherwise product was good  
 I have used this mobile from last 4 days so everything is good in less price,I m very thankful of flipkart for good service regarding delivery,quality 
 all features best but bettery life very low.camera sound and touch are very good . so i not recomended for bettery life lovers. 
 Most worst mobile... Battery backup is very poor. And camera is poor quality.... And mobile is heat in Internet 
 Looking its very nice mobile
Camera is not good.
Battery backup is very less.
While talking in phone voice is not clear. 
 Very bad experience had to return the handset bcoz of major problem always go for branded handset 
 Cheap one but is worthy of it. ( Why expect me to spend so much time reviewing it using at least 100 characters ?, OK, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ) 
 very very cheap Quality mobile i ever seen. Please don't buy this phone.

Worst Customer Care service. Never Buy hing from flipkart 
 not a good product.  
looks slim and light but the battery takes a battering... horrible.. discharges in just under ten hours with no talking... idlely kept and the battery runs out of juice... takes full marathon 3 hrs to charge.. and drains out faster than that like a sprint... camera quality not gud. 8mp and 2mp is a far cry.. in fact just as the old box phones... display is ok ok.. heats up a lot... the usb port and charger fit badly.. accessories just resemble the road kart throwaways.. but packaging tooo gud and designed to taste.. wish u dedicated more time developing ur phone instead... 
there r better 3g phones @ lesser price than this hyped 4g piece... disappointing micromax.. 
please test ur products before pushing them into market 
 Not such as aspected 
Very bad picture qulity 
Good looking only 
Dubba hi sirf
All the features are successful 
 this is to inform to all viewers of flipkart, that i purchased micromax xpress 4g on 21st november 2015.
 from the first day the mobile phone use to overheat, phone is very slow in processing, takes alot of time to display, touch is lacking doesnot perform function and gets hang immediately, if insert memory card the mobile gets too slow to function, 8 megapixel camera quality is also not appropriate according to mentioned features. the picture quality is very bad, it use to restart and ask for sim pin while waking from stand by mode, overall waste of money, time and customer trust, flipkart must verify the features before adding the product to its list. 
 Very good phone at this price.But bad Camera quality.The screen Guard in the box is also broken.Please REPLACE! it. 
 I got my mobile delivery on 28/11/15 I open box and check all items. I got damaged tuffun glass and usb adapter is also damaged. about mobile its remain to check.
I want to Replace Screen gard and Usb adapter from Flipkart. 
 i am purchased two mobiles, one box inside temper glass damage piece came and one mobile top of speaker some heat for talking call. 
 After checking of 1Hr I Found……
The Mobile is Heating heavily with out using Net and Games.
Mobile Camera quality is very poor like VGA and click the 1 snap automatically snaps are coming.
Touch is not working good its very slow responding.
Ear phone speakers are very poor quality. Only right speaker is working, left speaker is noise sound.
Most of the problem is Heating.  
 Camera is a big disappointment. Overall quality is poor. I was attracted because it was just launched and I expected an outstanding product in its range.,Dear Flipkart, something has gone amiss in our faith on you. Flipkart has refused to exchange this item for another mobile. 
 camera is not so good and also hanging problem occurring during process. touch is cheap and overall its a cheap product.. 
 camera, audio quality is very poor .. in same price YU TUPHORIA is best Mobile ..Dont buy this mobile.
Worst Camera Quality 
 WiFi gets connected but internet does not work. I checked with my other mobile connecting to same WiFi and it works perfect but this phone does not connect to internet even with its mobile data. This is intermittent issue. It will work on its own after few hours or days. 
Device has serious mic problem. The other end caller is complaining the voice is not audible. Not happy with the device as the basic functionality of mobile is not working as it should.  
Battery is draining very fast with very minimal usage itself. 
Highly dissatisfied with flipkart technical team. They suggested default template steps and closed the complained saying they shared troubleshooting steps. But the issue remains same... flipkart, please recruit skilled resources rather than head count. Learn to listen the customer and understand the problem. 
 your handset is not good canvas xpress 4g have 2 default one is camera clearity not good and wifi not supported its big issue in this handset. after replacement that problem again please tell what shoul i do m really very upset. 
why does happen with me?? please do something and give me suppourt 
 Totally waste of money
screen with full brightness also looks dim
camera worst than any cheaper model
heating ... can boil water
speaker ... one one listen to the otherside if we are in traffic
if there is any - 5 star i go for that
Please dont buy 
 Flipkart thanks for delivering product in only 1.5 days, but guys i didn't expect this type of quality from MMX  
Pros - 2gb, 4g, gorilla glass 3 
Cons - bad camera, bad design,bad screen gaurd.  
as of I have not gone through performance 2gb ram means I expect it should be good.. let's hope.
