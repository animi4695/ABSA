 I have been using this phone for a week now. Here is my honest review:
- The display is bright but low on ppi (194).
- The cameras are decent in daylight..but struggle in artificial light and low light conditions. Selfies in artificial light are grainy but bright. However the pics from both cameras lack detailing.
- Loud-speakers are not very loud.
- Audio output from earphones is good when you using a good pair of earphones.
- The battery is 3000mAH and the main reason for buying this phone. However, the battery does not last even a day with the data on and few whatsapp messages in a day. It drains in the same way with wi-fi on as well. i have to keep my data off to get maximum outta it.
- The update app keeps running in the background and sends notofications every now and then: this is the most irritating feature of micromax these days and also eats up the battery fast.
Final impression- you can get better options in this price range. But the battery could be an issue in my phone alone; need more reviews. 
 Its gOod brand mobile which we got from flipkart. Thank you for the service on providing quality things.
