 a very nice phone... good running performence and alll... for a small cheap good price from infocus .. u can buy this if u have a limited budget or else u can get some other good phone under 6k  
 i bought it in January 16 after 5 months usage i feel happy.it is good phone in basic model with all features. 
 a very nice phone... good running best price
I think this is the best phone under 4K
nice camera both friend and rear.
no lagging at all.. 1 GB ram. And 8 GB rom. 
 It is very good in all areas. Camera is good but the flash is not. Also calls might connect unintentionally while going through contacts and call list. Overall satisfactory for its price. 
 Best mobile...in 4000 its good n good goog good osm......... 
 Best phone at this price except some heating issue.the better gets too hot and the phone also gets hot after a little use..but the phone runs very smoothly. 
 Nice product and delivery. But no earphone in this product. Very fast delivery. 
 Features are fine at this price range. Except cam clarity is too poor and earphones are not provided. 
 Nice product good quality worth of price....................... 
 Great product at this cost. Please don't think to get it at great features.. 
 GOOD PRODUCT but there are some drawbacks at first it gets heating using it for 7-10mins flash light on camera is not timed well video calling on messenger and on other apps are supported BEYOND ALL THESE LIMITS ITS QUITE WORTH FOR OUR MONEY 
 Very good product.....it is very best phone in low price.I'm happy with this 
 Low cost but not cheap.it's best budget phone I have ever used, fits best in this price range 
 This is one of the best and also it is good in gaming experience

value for money. 
 Nice budget phone below 4k.as we compared to other phone but only battery is low for battery i am giving 3.5/5 
 Nice phone... In this some litil problem like charger is heat when pluged In.. Nd then phone is also.. Nd every thing is ok In this phone 
 ery excellent this phone this budget vry nice flipkart website is super and amazing fulls satisfy iam buying this product in this webstite overall good and excellent....thankyou  
 The phone is awesome. Qualities, build and pricing makes it unique.
Flipkart also packed it and delivered it the way, that it satisfied me a lot.
Phone review:
Display viewing angle and color reproduction is far from being perfect (but suits well at this price range).
Loudspeaker is noisy during both calling and music.
A lot of unwanted third party apps are preinstalled (bloatware) and covered a significant storage amount.
Lacks a proximity sensor during calling.
Call log and phonebook is irritating.
Camera lacks a "tap-to-focus" quality (fixed focus camera).
.
Everything else are beyond your expectation at this range. Stays cool during clash of clans. Battery optimization is excellent and suits with your style and fashion perfectly.
Buy it, root it, remove unwanted apps, modify the OS a bit and the phone is all that you want. 
 display is ok, charging cable is too short and battery backup is not good. otherwise product is product ist ok for 4k budget 
only problem is battery, and not having proximity sensor and phone is heating while calling time 
 All thing is good except camera , very poor camera,please improve it 
 InFocus M260 is a good product with a low price but earphone is not available in box accessories.
Touch is very well.
I love InFocus and flipcart for a good service.
I advised to buyer to buy this product without any FIKAR. 
 Great product at this price, Below 5000.
Descent Camera, but not much good at low light.
Except that everything is excellent. Performance, build quality, service center availability, all are great. Thanks infocus.
You can not get better product, at this price range.
Best at this range.
Value fot money. 
 Wanted a phone with just general requirements like for sometimes internet surfing and sometimes listening songs and hopefully should be able to play videos as well. 
But I didn't wanted to spend a lot of money for this. 
A little research on the internet some good reviews on Flipkart and on youtube.
Finally I decided to buy it assuming okay whatever it is we will see it later.  
Finally when the product was delivered by Flipkart. I was like, "this was unexpected".
I didn't expected the phone to work this better considering this a low budget phone. 
This is a flawless phone except for the flash given in the phone.  
I considered InFocus to be like all other phones who are not Sony, Samsung, Motorola, Lenovo. 
But this is different and provides you more than enough than you can ask for at this price.  
 This is perfect in budget phone. 
2 Phones buy ......
 I love filpkart and infocus tooo..... 
 nice phone, working seamlessly.
good battery life (3-4 days depending)
selfie camera poor.
decent phone in this budget.

 nice phone , nice camera at that price , nice looking , if you want to buy any mobile at low budget ( nearabout rs 4000 ) you can buy it without any hesitation 
 Great product in just 3.8k. No Lags at all. Great Performance by 1.3 quad core processor. good talk timeBattery Charge Last upto a whole day,but if u r using it heavily then battery will last upto only 6-7 hours. Then too its preety ok. Touch is very responsive. build quality is great. veiwing angle is not that good though. Camera is also good. Overall a good phone in budget. 
 nice mobile , but camera isnt upto the mark 
if u want a mobile with good cam , then i will not suggest u 
otherwise 
this handset is good for 
normal user 
i would say one of the best phone ,under 4k . (probably best under 4k)   
 Flipcart said it is 8 b internal But when check it was 4 Gb and i lost my ear Phones in Box and Can i get 
 I love it using frm past two months ...still now don't have any problem...... 
 Awesome phone at this range but camera clarity something disappoint me................ Guudd to see you the service of flipkart 
 Look like a box type phone. It is heating more than a normal one. Performance is also not good. Return policy is also not so good this phone on this website. So please don't purchase it. 
 this phone l.c.d verry low but nace phone and god betary and long lastik good phone 
 guys if u r looking for the phone within 4000 then its an perfect choice for u.....

 i have received this product but it is hanging, still i have not installed any software in it inspite of that it is hanging. 
 it doesnt hv front camera? because it dint mention anywher. please lemme knw as i ordered already.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I got it for 3657 and its a very good deal. It has 1gb Ram and 8gb internal. 
 really not satisfied with this set. when i got the box the ear leads were missing. and iam trying to return my order for 1 week. till now i didnt get any solution to the problem.really wastage of money 
 Flipkart Provide me 10 Day Replacement Guarantee, but after 15 Days My phone Speaker not working, Service center says that it will take 10-15 days in repair, how I can submit my phone to service center for 15 days 
 I brought it , with my first salary to gift to my father but , its totally embarrassing , i recived a used mobile i could see some pictures in the gallery the pictures where taken by the ecard shipping people i really dont want to gift to my dad now its used mobile 
 I have checked the specification it is not a 4G phone but flipkart mentions it as 4G network connectivity depends on carrier and location of the user. But in actual it is a 3G phone.
