FLIPKART SERVICE:---->Very Good(Got the phone within hours)  
VERDICT:---->Impressive (considering the price point) but don't expect it to be F-35 Lightning II, when in fact it is more like Sukhoi 35.  
----------------------------------------------------TIPS---------------------------------------------------- 
(1)Remove the bloatwares Installed By The Company-->To Free Ram & To Boost The Performance. And of course to gain some lost space.
(2)Reduce or Turn Off The Animations-->To Make The Phone More Responsive & To Resolve The Hanging Issues(If Any), Though i am Not Having Any Issues.
(3)Listen Through the In-Ears OR Earphones Whenever Possible-->To Conserve The Battery Power. 
(4)Right now the the phone is operating under kit Kat 4.4, which is basically a 32 Bit operating system, This means the Snapdragon "MSM8916 410" processor which is 64 Bit processor, is not performing optimally on this phone, once the phone is upgraded to the "ANDROID LOLLIPOP", which is a 64 Bit operating system,The performance of this phone is expected to rise up to 20% to 30%. Which is a very very good thing by the price factor of this phone.  
This is all i have got to share with you right now. Will Try To Keep On Updating.   
 In Kolkata Ordered the Phone on 25th May on the open sale (no registration was required), got it delivered finally on 31st May.So, Flipkart is not always so fast. Thumbs down here to Flipkart. 
Now about the Phone: Would not repeat specifications like most of the users. Just review:
Pros:
1) Look & feel - Inspite of being a 7.5K phone it looks very premium and is very light on palm.
2) Touch - It is extremely responsive and fluid. the 3 capacitive Android controls are also OK but not backlit. With more upgrades and Android Lolipop(5) the touch surely would become better.
3) CPU,GPU, RAM and ROM - Very fast and peppy. Game experience is also very good. No lags, no pixelation, no hang problem. Set all storage settings to memory card and you would get optimum performance always. I am using a 16 GB UHS Transcend card.
4) Camera - Front camera is very good and back camera is OK.There are many controls that could be customized which is very good. IF "HDR" is on then always 2 images will be taken per click.Picture quality for the front is excellent being a 2 MP snapper, for the back it is good & satisfactory. Do not forget to remove the LENS cover for better clarity and always set sharpness to "0".When using ZOOM for the back camera picture quality drops. Hope future updates fix it.
5) VIBE UI - It depends on user to user, but it felt great to me, easy to use/navigate. If you need pure Stock Android experience then use "Google Now Launcher".So far VIBE UI 2 in this phone does not allow features like "Double tap to on/off screen".
6) Applications could easily be moved to M-SD card. Do remove few unwanted pre-installed ones to free up some memory and better response.
7) Sound - Extremely good and almost comparable to iPhone or Blackberry sound. The twin speakers are pretty loud but to feel the real "DOLBY" effect connect it to a good external speakers or In-Ear headphone. I bought JBL T100A and let me tell you it is insane. Will recommend this JBL headphone as well.It has mic. as well.
8) Heating - All Android devices get hot while heavy usage or gaming. It is not a big deal as we all pretty much use at least a back cover. I bought a "Karpine Flip Cover for Lenovo A6000" it looks very premium,catch eye and does the job perfectly. I would definitely recommend this cover.
9) Battery - Like every other Android battery does not provide great backup but OK. On moderate usage it should last more than a day and that is your queue.
10) SIM - Only SIM slot 1 is capable of 4G/3G/2G; SIM slot 2 is only 2G.
11) Lastly - Do googling or search on YOUTUBE for Tricks and Tips and helpful stuff about this phone and you would not regret. 
Cons:
1) LENOVO should have provided backlit Android keys(just get used to it, not rocket science) as it would not have caused Lenovo much and perhaps notification LED as well. So Thumbs down here.
2) The screen does not have any added protection so opt for a tempered glass screen protector. I bought "Chevron T119 Two Screen Protectors" and let me tell you this product is very good and installation is also air bubble free. 
There is nothing called a best and always rooms for improvisation and improvement so giving it 4.Don't cry for the unavailability of headphone in the box because at this price range it is too much to ask for. Of course LENOVO could provide a cheap one but then you would again complain for the same would you not?? Be wise and take your decision.To remove google/Facebook/other accounts from this phone go to SETTINGS > Select the account > Select account name (tap) > Hit the left most android key(multitask) once > You'll see the REMOVE account hidden there. 
 I brought this product and frankly speaking i liked it initially. It was good phone with reasonable price. But after one and half month, my touch has stopped working. I contacted Flipkart, they advised me to visit Service Center for Lenovo smart phones. Then i visited HCL Touch Lucknow on 26th June. They checked it and told me that there is issue with touch plane and they have asked for part from some where. Today is 17 July. And I am still waiting for my phone. More over response of Lenovo service escalations staff is truly irresponsible.I sent a mail to them i got only automated reply that i will get a call or response.But that never happened. 
I strongly recommend a BIG NO for all Lenvo new Phone.
Go for Lumia/Samsung/Sony.... 
 Bought the mobile on 2nd Flash sale. Ive experienced a heavy heating issue with the phone and Battery backup just lasted for 3hrs in standby. So i asked for a Replacement but they Rejected it. So i planed to take it to the service center. Before going i read some reviews about the heating issues. So i used the mobile without memory card for a Day, i faced no heat and the battery is solid. Then i Formated the memory card in the mobile itself and using till now, its almost 3 weeks and the phone is excellent. Im happy with both the Cameras, it provides sharp images and HDR is Outstanding. 
 I have purchased Lenovo A6000. I got defective mobile handset. When I requested for redplacement/return they are giving any proper answer. 
Really very bad experience with flipkart. I will suggest to all online customer pls dont buy anything specially from flipkart.com. I am going to consumer forum for the same cause. 
 firstly i want to tell about the phone, then i will resolve some usres issue. 
phone is superb in its price range. 
processor- it has a power full processor which make the user experience good.
 for processor i will give 10/10 , using from morning and writing review at 1:30 am,
 i have not felt any lagging issue, not any application crash.. 
Camera- rear camera is not superb as you expect from the digit 8 Mp, but i want you make sure that camera is as good as zenfone 5, and moto g2, there is littile diffrence only which we call , 19,20(unnis, bis ka fark), the combination of flash is not good, it make object more lighty some time few parts are nt visible but if you click pics using flash then make sure that you are minimum 3 feet apart from the object then you will get good pic. 
and front camera as ususal is good as 2MP, can click..you feel proudy on your selfie. 
for rear camera I will give: 7.5/10
and for front camera its : 9/10. 
Battery- battery is good if you are a moderate to heavy user, and superb if you are a moderate user then its superb. 
in heavy uses it gives, 10 to 11 hour continue battery backup, and in moderate uses it will gives 1.5 to 2 day(assuming). 
after full charge.
for charging like other phones its also takes 2 to 3 hour. 
for over all battery performance i will give: 8.5/10 
sound, gaming - it has dolby dual speaker , which make our entertainment experience good, nice sound produced by this....while making call the voice of other side is bit low, but it is good if you think...bcz in some phones while talking some one without headset, the voice of other side is comes out and we have to manage it.. 
i played asphalt 8 it played the game very smoothly...didnt heat much...only normal heat is produced which is ignorable. 
before selling the phone lenovo, clear the all specs about the phone that there is no back lite or no otg support for this...
and it will not give us headfone...so whhy we give negative rating to this phone regarding this thing...it on us before purchasing be sure what the specs and what we will get..in accessories...I have no complain regarding this to lenovo, because it tries to give us to be a part of good android phone owner in this price range...7.5k. 
and now few users have problem with camera, application crash r lagging... 
--> for camera if you have not removed the polythene layer o=over the back camera..then please remmove..it is not visible and it is fix as our attention is not go on this...so please before clicking pic remove it from the rear camera......camera is really good. 
-->> for lagging you have to kill the some process to free ram...there is a method on you tube saying tips and trick for A6000 go for it, after doing that thing you will never feel any lagging issue. 
its all about mine review review about lenovo A6000.   
 I usually use this phone to iron my dress.the phone produces immense heat..
The 'battery percentage' is very much helpful for the children to learn numbers in descending within few minutes...thankzz lenovo

This is all i have got to share with you right now. Will Try To Keep On Updating. 
 Received the handset with manufacturing defects.
The technical team just ran a software which was malicious and somehow showed me everything is fine. whereas my problem of voice whenever i make a call still persists. And the technician kept reading a script and was adamant that no matter if i go to lenovo store or anywhere - i will not be getting any replacement and i have to live with this crappy good for nothing device . 
1star cuz there is no option for zero stars. 
 It stopped working after just Three months. The phone is dead now. 
It may be hard luck and I may have got a bad piece.
But what is unacceptable is their service. It has been 15 Days since I took it to service and till now its not repaired.
So before you buy a Lenovo A6000 plus consider visiting their service center, You will see a lot of people with faulty A6000 plus there. 
I am giving this phone one star because there is no way to give ZERO star  
 I purchased this phone and realized that it is heating up too much even if the phone is kept idle and battery was draining very fast. I have told to perform so many thing such as updating latest software, resetting the phone, but all in vein. Also, I visited lenovo service center and they suggested me to get the phone returned to Flipkart. I got it replaced with a new phone but still the same issue. Even I can say it was more than that. I got a message on the phone " WARNING! OVER BATTERY TEMPERATURE". 
I think there are few manufacturing defects in this model from the manufacturer itself. 
 I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PHONE. IT HEATED SO HIGH WHEN I GO FOR CHARGING. FLIPKART SAID THE HEATING IS NORMAL. I AM FEELING LOOTED. I AM VERY SAD. FLIPKART IS SICK NOW 
PLEASE DON'T BUY
PLEASE 
 I was using iPhone now wanted to switch to Andriod phone.....researched a lot and made a Lenovo as choice.....
Pros-
1.Fast Processing and Good storage, no lags
2.Good Front and rear camera, nice flash also.
3.Excellent Sound Quality earphone, speaker, Dobly feature is awesome.
4.Good battery backup. lasts for a day with moderate use
5.HD display is amazing.
6.Good Screen touch, not felt much difference with my earlier, shows smartphone market improved a lot.
7.No heat, not much heating compare to other phones
8.Lite weight phone.
9.Not Hanged till date with 20+ days of use. 
Cons-
1.Takes 2- 2.5 hours to charge completely which is huge, but its like the phone which charge fast heats up like anything even iphone was like.
2.Camera could be little more improved but with 7.5k its good. 
Less budget, good phone, worth investing than any 20k Phone, Must go for it if you looking for new smart phone.
Lenovo deserves these comments they made great phone under this price, they are going to rock the market if they go on delivering such quality products. 
Every phone has cons but it must be adjustable, this phone is better than any other phone in this price range, and such product comes very rare!!! 
Thumps up for this phone!!!!!!!!.... 
Avoid nuisance comments provided by some people!!! they are expecting Iphone6 quality in 7.5K, just avoid them.  
 i brought this phone during the big billion days..although this phone really boasts about its nice specs, the actual usage shows that the phone is not worth.
it gets hot even for a small usage,
the battery, drains down to 23 % from 100%, within 2 hours even after keeping the phone in flight mode.
overall i am very much unsatisfied with this product. 
 I Got this phone next day from order, im impressed by flipkart 
But disappointed from Lenovo, this is the 1st phone of my life which didn't come with handsfree. 
i should've read package content before ordering the product, thats why im giving 4 star 
EDIT 1 :- Facing heating issue in this phone 
EDIT 2 :- After 2 days using this phone, i must say that this phone have major heating problem, i used it 15 minutes regular use and its like im holding a heater in my hand 
Anyone facing the same problem like me? 
i wont recommend anyone to buy his phone 
please dont buy this phone 
 ""U should have to clean the ram for battery and heating issue...""
LOLLIPOP update is awesome...just after update make a factory reset to resolve the whatsapp contacts issue..
very good specs...
rear camera -7/10
front camera- 8/10
vibe ui- 8/10 after lollipop 9/10
antutu benchmark score is 21098..
cons...
the icons of the vibe ui like cartoon characters..
otg not supported..
minimum ek headphone to dena chahie tha..
screen is sticky type...finger impression becomes visible 
 Used this phone for a few days and this is what i experienced, hope it helps.
Pros.
1. Design - beautifully crafted, premium material hardware for 7.5K
2. Display- Crisp, sharp and highly responsive. great colour reprodution.
3. Connectivity- Absolutely no issues with regard to cellular network, GPS, Wi-fi etc.
4. Sound- Clear output, distortion free.
5. Camera- Superb Camera with superb results (for a phone under 8k and 8mp)
6. Gaming- Lag free due to 2gib ram.
Cons.
1. Both sims could have been 4G or at least the second sim as 3G.
2. Battery last a day with moderate use, but its too early to establish the truth since the phone a only a couple of days into use. Hopefully the battery should reach optimum output after a few more charging cycles. 
Recommendation.
1. We can never be happy with what we have and constantly strive to win this tech race. The point is to buy the right product and the right time and at the right price. i think at 7.5K, this phone is offering you feature worth every rupee. There in no end to research and tech growth. Buy this phone and don't look around for a year and disappointment wont set in. Good luck 
 I had order Lenovo 6000 plus on 5th may at sale but I got the faulty handset which not working properly and I am tried to tell to flipkart executive many times, but no one want to give any solution. I am having issue with this phone because 
 The phone touch does not work properly
 Camera working but due to the phone touch complaint I cant take pictures and videos
 The panel of keys below the screen also have issues, that keys not working properly
 The call end button also have no response
 I had called many time to Customer care but to appropriate response. This is my worst experience on E-Shopping since last 3 years. 
 so i am suggesting to all guys please don't go on line shopping with flipkart. 
 Getting straight to the point:
1) Major heating problem: As this is smart phone, every one must be expecting to use internet on it. After normal use of 15-20 minutes of internet or connection with laptop, it gets heat up much. After that its difficult to hold it to ear and talk with anyone. I complained for this to customer support. They measured the temperature of my device. It was going up to 41 degree. But as per the company's policy, up to 48 degree temperature of mobile, device is not heating up and working perfectly....!!!!!! Isn't this strange standard. In India maximum temperature in a city in summer might go to 45-46 degree, in which a human can not survive without support. But company is assuming it normal that one person can hold a device which is up to 48 degree hot and that is even normal..!!! As the company's standard is 48 degree, if your phone heats up below 48 no replacement from flipkart.!!!
2) Battery issue: It gets charged up to 15-20 % in an hour. So one need to charge it for 4-5 hours straight to fully charge it. Again complained about this, but as expected, it is normal from company's point of view. Now imagine, who gets 5 hour time in the morning to charge it fully before going to office.???
So I straight away and strongly recommend, NOT TO BUY THIS PHONE if you are a internet user.
I would love to give 0 star for this product. But that is not option given so 1 star. 
 First of all, let me thank Flipkart for on time delivery of this awesome product. 
Now, for all those haters, I have to say: 
1. Guys, are you serious, complaining about a phone with only 7.5 k and comparing it with the phones worth approx 20k.
2. I am using this one from last two days, and I must say, performance is rock solid. Its smooth, fast and great performer for daily users like me. Mind it, am not talking about hardcore gamers or people who need their smartphone stuck to their hands 24X7, coz I am not of them.
3. The feel on hands is very comfortable with its Matte back and its super light.
4. In this price range, you will get only one more phone (with almost same features), i.e, Yu Yuphoria. Now, it should not be too difficult to choose between Lenovo and Yu. 
Overall i want to say, if you want the best of everything then you will have to spend accordingly. I feel sorry for people who crib about everything just for the sake of it when they are willing to spend only 7.5 k. 
Guys, just go for it blindly if this is what your budget is, you cant get better than this.
And if you want better one, then don't hesitate to lighten your pockets. 
 Pros:
Works without lag,Slim design,Less weight,no heating issues 
Fix for heating and battery draining issues: 
It happen due to mediaserver (see apps->manage applications->all apps)
click mediaserver and disable it (Its for show pics and videos in memory card in an gallary) then download "Quickpic" app(It shows pics and videos even mediaserver disable it) instead of gallary app 
If you want shows pic and videos in stock gallery go to disabled app in an manage applications then reenable it and restart (NEVER clear cache in an mediaserver) 
Heating and battery draining happens only when you use memory cards
Try remove memory card and use mobile one day then you will see the difference 
 It's like you have a portable heater in your pocket.
But it heats up just by listening to music for 2 hours. 
Performance ,Graphics are good .
but the battery is inefficient. 
Pity, Flipkart doesn't consider it as a defect .they will just waste your time and wont do anything.
So don't waste your money.  
 Good specification. But did anyone notice any hanging issue like application stuck for a second during use? I am facing this issue every time. Example if i want to scroll the contact it is freezing for a moment periodically. i don't know whether my handset is defective or it is a common problem for all a6000 plus. 
 Warning:- Don't Update the new software as it is heating up the device too much and draining the battery too fast!! 
if u update then you need to reset the device(all data lost) to get the device as it was earlier.
some media server is taking too much battery if you update the new software . 
However here is the review  
I Got The Smartphone Today and Flipkart Delivery is Just Awesome!! 
The phone has great list of features at this price point because of which other brands had to cut the price of there smartphone probably , to name some Moto G 2 , Huawei Honor Holly etc. 
After 12 hrs of my usage here is the review !! 
RAM 2 GB is adding great value to the phone
16 GB internal is also an added edge over others
Camera Is Best under this price point
Dolby Speakers are treat to ear 
No Earpiece with This A600 Plus ( A6000 Was Having One)
You get a screen guard with this
Light Weight  
Battery backup has given good response with 10 hrs of backup with 30 % charging still left
Touch And HD Display Is Also Good 
After Comparing it with Moto G 2 , 
In every aspect Lenovo A6000 Plus Is a Winner 
(Battery is awesome giving backup of 1.5 days) 
 The Lenovo A6000 Plus phone I purchased disappointed me. Last few days I observed the phone is turning off (swith off mode) by itself while on standby around 8PM and the same technical fault was observed by me last three days more or less at the same time continuously. The power on operatioon thereafter is not happening with the power on button. I am forced to remove the battery and place it back and then the power on button responds. This is a serious technical fault and I find no use when the phone goes to a dead mode (switch off mode) while on standby as the user will be unaware of the status of the phone and might even end up missing important calls. Rest of the features and performance is good. Battery is taking a little longer to recharge but I suppose it might improve after a number of recharge cycles. 
 I am not sure, where this went wrong but we are not expecting this either from Flipkart or its Subsidiary retailer WS Retail. 
I ordered lenovo A 6000 plus and guess what, all i got was BOX for A6000 Plus with A6000 (older version), inside. 
I was under assumption, Flipkart and its sellers are providing us with sealed items but under the light of above mentioned incident i am not longer able to have that trust. 
Just to clarify, flipkart has accepted the return request and the same is under processing as of the time of writing this review/complain. 
But the question remains,how can an older model be inside the newer box (accessories and manual included)?? 
Thanks,
Atul 
 WIth in 2 days of uses, touch behaving weird. I am pressing something else and it is typing something else. And I have put a phone lock and now I am not able to unlock it as a row of digits became un-responsive. I am not able to even factory rest or reboot phone (only option is to take out battery). But still cannot login due to dead tocuh. Also there was high heating issue. Please please dont buy this.
I have raised return request to flipkart on 15th aug. Lets see if they give better piece now else I will escalate this issue to highest level. Really disappointed with the phone.
Anyone knows how to give MINUS five rating? 
 I bought Lenovo A6000 plus mobile from flipkart on 28-Apr-2015. Since then I am facing heating problem with the phone and charging is drastically decreasing. Even to charge to 100% also it is taking 6 to 8 hours. I did all the troubleshooting steps which flipkart's executive has told, still the issue remains. Also i cant see photos in my sd card through gallery app. I even formatted the sd card. Resetted the phone. In any way i am not able to succeed. 
Yesterday I again resetted the phone and did not installed SIM card and memory card, I put it as like I got the phone on first day from flipkart still the phone is heating and battery is decreasing exponentially.  
So I am suspecting this piece is a defective one accidentally. 
 I was using Xiomi Redmi 1s and was very happy with it. The only issue I had was that the battery backup was bad for Redmi 1s. I have been using this for 1 week now and would like to tell you guys that Its the best choice I made. The battery backup for this phone is just amazing, not to forget the 2GB RAM makes the phone super fast. You would love it if you like light weight phones. I feel happy when I return home and I dont have to put my phone on charging as it still has juice left. Also it gives you the option to move apps to SD card, so that is great. Overall if you have a budget for 7-8K, go for this phone without any second thoughts. 
Note : Lenovo has promised Lollypop update on this, so it only gets better from here.  
 the pre-installed security app could not be removed and it will charge you for virus definition update..how could lenovo do this thing to there customer.?first we buy from u then again we have to pay for your app which is not good..you are cheating us..and there are good free antivirus in market..why should i pay for your crap..and it can't be uninstalled also..so once you buy a lenovo phone you are in their hand to pay for the anti virus software continuously..
More..
camera is average(front camera is good,back camera is bad,bad)...touch feeling is not soft(not as good as redmi 2)..UI is o.k(MIUI is much better)..hardware performance is good(better than redmi 2)..i would give it 4 star..but again i have to spend money and continuously..?i will never buy a lenovo product..
More..
humm..battery is another problem..it drains fast when you use internet or play games or any other works..it also generate much heat..at the time of charging also..charging time is much slower..but in my case stand by time is sufficient..all i do is to clear the ram,also turned off internet or location and then make it stand by....
More..
game playing is smooth..no lagging..even big games run smooth..sound quality is o.k..
More..
A big security concern..eset mobile security after full scan is alerting two system file from lenovo(not from google i think) as threat..some kind of malware variant and as it is included in system file,it can not be removed yet by eset..lenovo's own security showing nothing..what is going on lenovo..? 
 After the lollipop update this phone turend out to be soo fast and the camera clearity increased by 200% i bet you cant get a good phone with good coustomer service in this price. i am ordering 2 more for other peoples in my family at fist i thought that ii wasted my money over lenovo then i realied that i have the product in my hand after lollipop update this phone turned out to be insane loving it. i will recommend it to a freind because this phone turned out to be awsome now......... 
 Mobile was over heating and battery drains faster. backup is not more than 2 hours.
Except these rest all good.  
 good only but not much you should take charger in ur hands but in this budget it is good phone better u go to honor mobiles if u have 9000 
 Has been using this phone (Lenovo A 6000+) for 7-8 days now.  
The only usage that this phone gets is Skype video call over 3G network for max of an HR a day....  
Yes!!! that less usage per day. 
And still it doesn't meet even the lowest of standards of a phone in it's range. 
1. Heats up instantly.
2. Battery drains at a phenomenal pace.
3. High charging time
4. Battery drains even when idle for 20 HRs a day after a full charge 
Not at all functioning as per the specs defined 
As per other reviews, even exchanging doesn't help as the product itself is not up to the mark. 
Flipkart, stop branding sub-par products as 'Flipkart Advantage' without doing proper due diligence first. 
Lenovo: for god's sake.... stop cheating people and damage your own brand name 
VERDICT: Buy something else in same range, but not this product. 
 Please avoid this phone, just for the above mentioned reason. It turns off automatically at random intervals and there is no solution to it. I have tried everything that's possible, but sadly no use. Looks like Lenovo doesn't care and so does Flipkart, (they cancelled my return by providing some technical troubleshooting steps which made no difference) 
Note: There's an ongoing thread on Lenovo support with many other customers facing the same issue. 
 this is not a good product i have buy with our two other friends but is not a good product network connectivity, heating , and hanging is major problem. when i m facing these problem than than complain with flipkart they no any assist me if your mobile is not working good than what you do no connectivity. Before buy they asked FREE & EASY
RETURNS after buy they not agree with this.  
 Before buying this device I did a huge research on budget smartphones , selected 4 smartphones and revaluate all prose and cons .
1.Asus Zenfone 5
2.Lenovo A6000
3.Redmi 2
4.Android One [spice]
------------------------------------------------------------
1.asus zf5 has heating issues [may be all device has] but it has best camera allthough worst battery 
2.Lenovo A6000 decent camera [best color reproduction] and as the previous model has 1GB ram [it may have issues with ram management]
3.Redmi 2 , previous version which was redmi 1S has best camera & redmi 2 also have a good camera but it click over exposed pictures[best detailed captures] but nor colors, Doesn't have feature "App2SD",heating issues,etc.
4.Android One [spice] all android one devices are for first time android buyers that what I belive
[google it about its cons] it has cons higher then pros.
Then a new model came known as A6000 Plus & it comes with 2GB Ram & 16GB Rom and all the goodness of its previous model, so ended with it.
Now about the phone:
Excelent Phone no heating issues what so ever , no lag, Super Display, out of 2GB Ram you will get 1.45GB available and out of 16GB Rom user available is 11.35GB which is great, One can install apps , games directly from SD card , call quality is excelent , no call drops, Beyond Excelent Battery if you dont do any thing from 100% even after 1hrs 25mints it will be 100%. 
It has some hidden features which I just explored and found that is " Time Lapse video Recording" similar to motos "SloMo".
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now about Flipkart:
Really Really Thankyou Flipkart for your Aswome Service , I Registered it on 17/04/2015 Ordered in on 28th may & its mention it will be delever it on 6th may but Flipkart Delevered it on 2nd may, thats why I am doind shopping with Flipkart from past 2years.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
About Package Contains : Lenovo A6000 Plus
Handset,usb data cable,charger,screen protector.[headphone is not included (mic)]
[for headphone(mic) I recomend 
JBL T100A Headset or Skullcandy S2IKDY-010 Ink'd Headset 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note : After purchasing I checked it on lenovo india website for Warrenty by pasting the model no or IEMI no. provided my flipkart invoice and found it has companys warrenty for 1 year so no need to register your device. which is hassel free. Lollypop Update for this device will be on 2nd Quater of 2015. Link is here Check it for warrenty : 
http://support.lenovo.com/in/hi/warrantylookup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion : I really feel happy for my buying decision for Lenovo A6000 Plus
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 I didn't get this in the flash sale.
Flipkart gave me a priority pass as im an extreme shopper on their website. 
i bought this as a secondary device to my zenfone 5 and wanted to shift to this due to these reasons
>the battery backup on Z5 sucks big time.This having a slightly better capacity battery of 2300 mah and a snapdragon cpu which is power efficient should definitely be good.
>the speaker or zenfone 5 is so low ,this device powered by dual speakers and dolby enhanced must definitely be better. 
coming to the phone,
Yeah....its INR7499.
trust me its the best at that price point.
I personally hate the lenovo vibe UI though.Its very messy-no app drawer,everything comes on the home.I changed the launcher.But still the icons are shitty too.
there's no earphones in the box but you do get a screen guard.
performance is smooth. 
the main pro-the battery backup is amazing.....you can easily get around 36-48 hours on moderate usage and around 20 hours on heavy usage with over 5 hours ov screen on time.
the speakers are phenomenal and its a treat to the ears.Use some premium earphones.
iv a jbl 101A and the music through dolby enhancement is top notch.Further u feel like you are in PVR IMAX if u watch any 5.1 channel hd movie. 
now the cons
>no notification LED.As i was previously a user of a moto E,G and a zenfone ....i miss this feature.Lenovo shouldn't have overlooked this as this feature wouldn't have costed them a big deal.
>no usb otg support
>no backlit keys
>no gorilla glass
>service centres of lenovo aren't quite good. 
finally,
u can go for it if you're tight on budget(i bought this as a secondary device to my zenfone 5),else go for motorola phones.They're better than this. 
 Heating problem, slow battery charging and quick battery draining issues from the date of receipt of the phone. Contacted flipkart several times for replacement and they told that the seller has been disagreed for replacement. So they told me about the many consequences I have to undergo. It made me desperate and helpless. My phone frequently goes to 46 degree Celsius temperature. Its very ridiculous to deny best customer support to each customer who trusts you. I'm fed up with this inconvenience happened to me. Phone is good to see but can't use for more than 15 minutes/ a 3 minutes call/ a 2 minutes movie watching. It takes 6.5 hours to get fully charged and looses it within few hours even it is idle. 
 first of all Guys its an awesome phone ..a must buy... 
problems faced by users and their solution:-
1) camera not so clear 
solution -..just set the sharpness level to level 0 ,exposure if needed to level 1( for front camera), touch AF to ON and last anti bandind to auto mode ...and feel a llthe difference in clearity:) 
2) music volume:- just go to Dolby app > music > turn all 3 settings to off mode the volume will be enhanced :) 
3)In my opinion the battery is working excellent ..but fir some users who are not satisfied disble and force stop all unnecessary apps or stock apps like google plus and all in settings ...and keep brightness to auto or low level whenever possible ..it will help our battery life :) 
performance 9/10
look 8.5/10
light weight phone
battery 8./10
display 9/10
speed 9/10
...
VERDICT:- Go for It ;) best buy for 7500:) 
THOSE who have this ...Install ZUI LOCKER from play store its awesome ;) 
 A6000 phone is switching off suddenly. Battery has some issues and side button does not work. Need to remove the battery and place again to make it on. 
Returned and got new piece that also has the same issue.  
 all the time phone is heated, no stand by, no talk time in this phone. tooks 10 hours to charge ,charge at very slow rate, but battery consumes at faster rate even not in use . phone looks features are good but phone heating problem and battery issue makes it too bad option to Buy .  
 got the product delivered on 10-may-2015. charged for whole 24hrs, but when turned on @11Am on 11-may-2015 battery=100% @12noon 11-may-2015 battery drops down to 85%. 
Note: During that time (11-12) no sim card inserted, nothing has been done.  
By 02:40AM 12-May-2015 (i.e total 15hrs of uptime) battery drops to 35% (operations performed - changed theme,connected to wi-fi for 10-15 min max). 
Did any one else face this issue? 
 battery dranker fully.battery back up is only 3 hours if u are using only some phone used.
no body write here for the battery dringking  
 Very strange!! the mobile shuts down on its own and does not start. I have to remove the battery and re-fix and then the phone works perfectly well. Do anyone experience this kind of a problem? what is the solution? 
 Amazing speed. Nice phone with great features. Only the problem is it's battery which is not sufficient for a day's usage. Bit disappointing one. Other than this, every thing is fine and fantastic. 
 Pros:
 A good phone for the price of 7K.
 2 GB RAM
 16 GB Internal Memory 
Cons:
 NO EAR PHONES. Really disappointed with that
 No Corning Gorilla Glass (Same price Yu Yureka has it) 
 Camera is 8/2 MP (YuYureka is 13/5 MP)
 Screen is 1280X720 (Yu Yureka is 2040X1280)  
 I was disappointed with this phone. The audio is very low while speaking. I raised a ticket to flipkart and they closed my ticket saying the issue is resolved.  
The phone doesn't meet the basic need of a phone (low volume on call). Please don't buy this phone.

 Hello All, 
I have bought Lenovo A6000 plus from Flipkart some 15 days back. Returned the product within 5 days due to batter issue and very high level of heating of the phone. 
I got replacement of the phone - still same issue. So the culprit was not the battery and I started looking for solution. 
The issue was with the SD Card (I used 32GB SD Card as is form my older android phone running on v4.2) To try 
1. I backed the data on SD card, erased the data completely while the card was in new phone (Lenovo A6000 plus).
2. un-mount the SD card.
3. Shutdown the phone.
4. Remove the SD Card from it's slot.
5. Start phone without SD Card.
6. Keep phone running for around 2-3 minutes.
7. Shutdown the phone.
8. Insert the SD card which was erased and un-mounted into SD card slot and start the phone.
9. Start using the phone for around 10-15 mins.
10. Now do one last shutdown and start of the phone.  
This procedure has helped me resolve the high batter consumption issue as well as excessive heating issue of the phone.  
Hope this will help others to get similar issues resolved.
After this the phone runs very smoothly and of course as suggested by others here try to disable/uninstall unnecessary softwares that comes pre-loaded. this will help in making phone even better in terms of responsiveness and increased internal storage will be added benefit. 
Thanks,
Swapnil 
 An upgraded version of A6000.
Nothing changed from previous except storage and ram,
Feels very light, Awesome camera.
Great service by Flipkart delievered the product within 17 hours. 
 Phone specs say:
The Lenovo A6000 Plus comes with a 12.7 cm (5) HD display for viewing photos, browsing websites or playing games. This smartphone uses an IPS technology to deliver ultra-wide 178 degree viewing angles that are great for watching videos in large groups. 
Dolby Digital Plus audio technology. 
8 MP rear camera that clicks great pictures. 
Practically:
Average screen, not very good viewing angles, colours get darker when phone is tilted a bit. 
Speakers installed on the phone suck, they are hardly audible and sound very cheap. You hardly hear the incoming call tone even after volume is maxed. 
Camera though they say is 8 MP but pics taken in any setting are noisy and blurry. Disappointed hugely with the camera. 
Far more superior features on the paper, very cheap product and quality. I feel like I should not have bought this phone. 
 Compared it with xiaomi redmi 2, and moto e...
Nd aftr compairing it with these two phnes..lenovo A6000 plus is the winnr.. 
 Good: 
speed, storage, touch, less price, display, screen size, look. 
Flipkart delivererd in 16h. 
Bad: 
No earphones. 
 Good Phone from lenovo.
working well,No heat Issue.
battery back Up More Than 24 Hours(as i am average user) 
Only thing i am confused with this is
1. only on the box it is written Lenovo A 6000+
2. when i check device Information it shows A6000
3. same A 6000 is written on back Side(After Removing battery). 
So i am confuse is it actually A6000 Plus or A6000 
If Anybody shows Plz. Help.  
 Guys Believe me it says 4g but when u use browser crashes not only for me what ever problems im saying now are even experienced by my friends it says 2gb ram but it stucks touch screen is very bad you will fail to unlock the phone in your first attempt, and the display is soo bad in quality you will get scratches on it easily with your nail ,,,this is the worst phone i have ever seen plz dnt buy try some other phone and company never ever buy lenovo phones ....and i'm rating this1 start so that every one can see my review ,,but i think flipkart will hide true reviews so they could bluff more people and cheat them.. 
 Pathetic product, Heating issues, loudspeaker sound is bad, Save your money.
once its heated, battery drains fast as hell! 
Camera n rest things are good. but can find better products in market 
 I would recommend "not to buy this stuff" due to following reasons:
1. Heating is a very huge issue while charging and talking both.
2. There is no Dolby digital effect unless you use some good company's ear phone. In fact it's sound quality is as good as normal phone. And it has a sound problem in handset while talking.
3. The most important is net connectivity. I am using Airtel 3G for the internet but it is too slow to browse a single page. I couldn't mind if it is 2G connection. 
4. It's battery suddenly drains out and take time to charge it again. I don't think 2300 mAh battery should have this type of problem.
5.It's touch is not working properly. In fact despite several attempt pattern key took time to unlock the phone. And not working very smoothly.
6. Not to buy, save your precious money. 
p.s. :- I bought this phone on 2nd.June.2015 in flash sale. And in view of above point i am returning back. 
 I don't know if I have received a defected piece or there is a problem with all the pieces. 
Primary issue:  
The battery is pathetic, even if the mobile has been charged completely it will not last more than three to four hours that too when barely a few calls were made and a game was played for 15 minutes.  
I kept the mobile on sleep mode despite of it the battery keeps draining.  
This mobile is only suitable for those who work from home.  
Anyone who is a business professional, student, or a person who has to travel a lot shouldn't consider buying this phone.  
Secondary issues 
Camera:  
Camera quality is poor, the images you take from the front cam are not good. Especially when the images are taken with flash mode on.  
Front camera is relatively better.  
Mobile body:  
Again i don't know if it I got a defected piece or every piece is the same but sometimes when the mobile is switched off and you try to start it by pushing the power button it doesn't start. You have to open the back cover pull the battery and then place it again in order for the mobile to start.  
This is something of a serious issue.  
The review has been written after using the mobile for three days anyone planning to purchase this mobile should think twice.  
I have ordered products worth more than 40k from Flipkart but this time I am a bit disappointed by the product.  
Service from Flipkart was good but Flipkart should ensure that products delivered by there platform is fulfilling customer expectations.  
The main purpose of a mobile is to make and receive calls and this mobile is good at it only when you are at home. As soon as you leave your home you won't be able make or receive calls because your battery will be dead.  
Consider my advice "Don't Buy"   
 At first I Would say Thank You Lenovo for giving this great phone in this range. 
I can Bet nobody gives you this Configuration in this Price.  
 This Phone's Camera is Showing its Awesomeness. Great Camera I have ever seen. 
 I can play Asphalt 8 , Dead triger 2, Mortal Kombat 5, Fifa 15, GTA 4 at a same time..NO Lagging Issue. 
 Awesome Display Quality With 5 Point Multi-Touch. 
 It gives me At least 1.5 Days Battery Back up with Heavy Usage.  
 This phone have Volume Boost Option, When you are in call you can Boost your Calling Volume and you can hear Clear Sound of your Caller in Noisy area. (This is one of My Favorite Option)  
Don't believe fake Reviews. This is Awesome. I have No Problem in My Lenovo A6000 plus. Plz Register and BUY 
 Lenovo 6000+ is jest a great phone & its never Lag &processing os Lightning Fast
I bought 2 phones one after One 
 I was eager to get my hands on this phone as soon as my previous phone Nexus 5 developed network issue (just days after warranty was over). So I registered for sale, got one in my cart and got it delivered today. 
To my disappointment, the primary function of phone (call, in case you thought it would be whatsapp chat or facebook) is pathetic. I get full network bars and call quality is perfectly fine with the other phone I am using here. So, I tried hands free, factory reset, a headset (none included with this phone though) - result is same. I can hardly hear other person, though they can hear me well. The voice is not just low but really breaks, like of which happens when the speaker is damaged or when network strength is low. Its not just with phone calls i made but also with phone calls i received. 
I am very much hoping that the problem is just with the piece and not in general. Requested for replacement on Flipkart, will check with new piece and update here. 
Apart from this,
Good:
- Screen size is fine
- Camera seems okay 
Poor:
The phone takes long time to boot.
Display touch feels very grainy. 
I haven't used phone more than few minutes, so can not comment more. Keeping it unused for replacement. 
Anyone else facing similar issue? 
 A6000 phone sitched off suddenly
A6000 phone is switching off suddenly. Battery has some issues and side button does not work. Need to remove the battery and place again to make it on. 
Returned and got new piece that also has the same issue. 
 1.Front cam is better than back camera!!I
t is surprising but it is true in my case.
2.If u use more apps, Battery does not last longer.
Less battery backup.
3.But internal memory 
is vast.
4.Nice flashlight.
5.Pre installed apps are good.
6.IT IS A GOOD PHONE OVERALL.IT IS THE BEST PHONE IF U COMPARE PARALLELY WITH OTHER PHONES OF THIS PRICE RANGE.
THIS PHONE HAS GETS MORE POINTS BECAUSE OF THE 2GB RAM,VAST INTERNAL STORAGE: 
I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO BUY WITH 7.5K 
 this phone switch off automatically, there is problem in regarding light of back switc and phone is having in speaker and during call voice is not clear 
 didnt expect it from flipkart got my phone from flipkart its just overheated and hanged. and also no battary backup request to replace but didnt replace my phone worst customer response service.. 
 ///////////////// IMPORTANT /////////// 
is anybody else facing problem while connecting headphones to a6000+. when i connect hands free i hear miffed sound the sound quality is not clear.I tried various other headphone but to no use. please tell if any body is facing the same problem  
 The device works great in every aspects but as we all know No Phone Is Perfect...Here are some Cons and Pros after 3days usage..
PROS:-
1:- Display Quality Is Awesome with great touch response 
2:- No Lagging or Heating( Very very Less )
3:- Apps can be moved to the SD card
4:- VIBE UI To some extent it is great but Stock android would have been better
5:- Lollipop update coming in Q2 This Year
CONS:-
1:- No Display Protection
2:- Screen guard provided is finger Print magnet
3:- No Earphones
4:- No OTG 
5:- Camera is just pathetic not looking like a 8MP much much worse than Redmi 2   
 Mobile is getting heated up very quickly and quality of Camera is bad
they are not providing the headset.   
 Phone is getting heated soon.After attending a call for a minute also it gets heated.Hanging after installing 20 apps in 2hrs..Not satisfied with the piece..Only advantage is lightweight. 
 Brought this phone after careful comparision it outruns the top company phones in features but comes with decent budget. using it since month, I got LOLLIPOP update in the august end and the performance is excellent than kitkat. Software is stable and no lags. Tried some top end games with good performance. Battery backup is excellent but takes a bit time to recharge. no draining of battery during non use. camera quality is good. Sound quality is very good in earphones ( i bought hp headphones for this) 
 Dear all I have purchase one for me and 3 for my sister's. So in total 4. I never face any sort of issue with this handset and after Getting Lolipop update it makes me very happy. Go for it, don't fall in trap and don't compare with a phone worth 10k or above. Go for it. Believe me its just amazing phone at 7.5k. For any more question you can contact Flipkart customer service. They are very good and co-operative. 
 light weight
shape is lovely
quality of product is nice
screen is OK
battery backup is nice
no hanging with games or with apps 
 Hi people, 
With in two days of the product purchase I faced Hang problem and when I started calling flipkart for the return , they said that the product is on Replacement and it cannot be returned . The phone can be replaced but only if flipkart decides it has a Touch and function problem. It has been a week now I have been getting calls to troubleshoot only. Flipkart is neither Replacing nor receiving back the faulty product.  
Shameless customer service !! I would not recommend this product to anyone. 
 all specification are very attractive .
but i face problm in touch screen i press keyboard key down left corner which is not easily press. 
 this phone has many issues
the phone looks perfect with its many features. but buyers forget one thing that is too many features = too many applications = too many processing that means the processor is running all time , and the phone has a antivirus called "NQ mobile security" which is running all time and draining battery, as we do not have the root permission we can not remove it. There are many application like this, this is harmful for processor and the battery.
As a result with in 2 MONTHS my phone operating weird like, doing operations itself, discharging fast.
don't know why the phone companies are giving so much applications knowing that they can harm the phone battery and the processor like they are running all the time. Is this a some kind of promotion !!! 
 Happiness is when you get phone worth 7499 in 6299,Thanks Flipkart for app sale day. 
-Phone weight is very light
-The vibe UI gives you the feel better screen appearance than other 5" phones
-The dolby digital system is great,if you have better headphone(philips she 1360 is good budget headphone mrp 160 to go with this phone)
-Best part is 2gb ram and 16gb intenal memory(12 gb usable)
-Rear camera s 8mp,searched net for some settings to maximize use of this camera,didn't find any,if please some one should post it  
Two important advice 
-Make sure to uninstall apps before use,if not the become system app and you will not be able to uninstall them later
-Formatting micro sd card is essential to avoid heating problem!!! Thanks for reviews  
Not mentioned in description
The airtel 4g card given can only work if you have already an airtel connection  
 Apparently flipkart is not ready to take any responsibility on there electronic products. Unless its a hardware damage issue. 
If its an heating issue or hanging issue flipkart will not take any responsible, neither will replace or repair even if its within 30 days. 
 in this product earphones they haven't provided. before gifting pls think once.
so embarrassing NO EARPHONES!!!!!

- Display is very smooth and vibrant.
- Very light weight.
- Vibe UI has no application tray hence all the apps reside in the home screen itself. However if you don't like this you can always change it with the 'google launcher' app. 
Performance: (9/10)
- No lags thanks to 2 gb ram, I have like 12+ application installed still no drop in performance.
- No lags even while playing high end games, However warms up a little.
- In-built storage is also very good (available 11.2gb /16gb) 
Camera:
- Front camera is good (8/10)
- Rear camera is very bad (4/10) 
Sound: (10/10)
- Sound is excellent, I think one of the best features of this phone.
- Use the 'dolby app' when you are using your mobile earphones. If not, switch off the 'dolby app'. 
Battery: (8/10)
- Battery Backup is also very good, Will easily run more than a day on average usage.
- Battery takes around 3 hrs to charge. 
Note:
1) No back-lit buttons.
2) No LED notification.
3) No OTG support.
4) No scratch resistant glass. (Gorilla Glass, Dragontrail etc.)
5) No head phone available in the set, however the one which they gave with lenovo a6000 was very cheap, so that's not an issue.
6) Currently runs on 4.4 kitkat. Will get lolipop update by june. 
Overall its a great buy for the price. I recommend every one to buy this phone whose budget is less than 12K, you won't be disappointed. 
 Hi Frnds..
Don't Go for the Specification of that phone they make every people fool.
be in real every one knows if Company has no profit then he will not sell any phone.
This Phone has Below issues:
*Low Hardware Quality and Poor Software.
*rear camera:2 MP nokia Camera quality is better than 8MP of this phone Camera.
*the body below the battery is attaching with paper if u push then it will be broken down easily.
*Sould quality is not good ...calling sound is not audible.
*UI of Phone is looking like small child drawing something on screen.
*charging time is very long 3hrs.(10%-90%). while using this heats like a HEATER.
*No OTG Support. 
*it stucks if user scrolling contacts or scroll some page.
Network support:
sim1 Supports 3G,4G 
sim2 Supports only 2G. 
MY Suggestion: 
Please do not buy This Phone.(if u buy at most it will Work 5-6 Month). 
if you want a phone for long time with less budget then best IS MotoE (2nd GEN).
Add another 500 rs and Get the Lolypop OS and comparing to this phone that is 100% better Phone. 
IMP: 
if you wrongly order this item you can not return/exchange this product. 
you have only option for replacement which flip kart makes every people FOOL. 
Flip Kart Make me FOOL and FORCE Me to Stay ON this Cheap Product.     
 Pros: Sensitivity ok.
Speed Ok
Mild heat with usuage of data and games 
Cons: No head phones
Back panel looks cheap plastic. 
Does not lock easily.. Has to press carefully to lock it completely 
 I've used the lenovo a6000 plus for 2 weeks,and i must admit the fact that its a wonderful phone worth every penny
After 2 weeks usage what i felt: 
Pros:Design,Ram and storage 
Cons:rear camera average,no back light,no led indicator 
 1.packing was very nice with triple protection...
2.delivery was on time.
3.the back colour(red) of phone really gives very different look.
4.its a budget phone with twin audio (dolby).
5.vedio quality is fantastic.
6.bright colour screen with smooth touch. 
the only things which lacks is-
1. no headphone with this mobile.
2. old kitkat version  
bt if u can ignore this, then overall phone is fantastic.
flipkart proved 'ab har wish hogi puri'.. 
 In my opinion, after using almost a month, every thing in this phone is good except with battery backup.  
I have also purchased Lenovo A7000 for my cousin brother, I figured it out that battery of Lenovo A7000 is much better than A6000 plus.  
My heart goes down, when I came to know about the special offer price of Rs. 500/- flat off on A6000 by Flipkart.com and with enhanced offer by SBI a 10% flat discount which makes the phone at unbelievable price of Rs. 6300/-.  
Now, I have again ordered this for my wife and referred to one of my friend, who also purchased it.  
Overall, about phone, decent sound, touch is OK but 7000 is have better than this.  
Main, feature it has is its inbuilt Antivirus provided by the Lenovo, it is very good options for user security. Providing anti theft facility additional benefit. Which is absent in Lenovo A7000.  
Local languages are also provided inbuilt in Lenovo A6000plus but absent in Lenovo A7000.  
If we talk about power using, then its battery will die in 3-4 hours, thats it.  
We are thinking of 4G, but we all know, 3G and wifi sucks the battery very fast, so think what will happen if we use the internet on 4G, I think it will die in 2 hours at the max.  
I think, company should take care about battery issue.  
The screen guard provided with the handset is very cheap quality. The charger and data cable are of good quality.  
I have to spend another Rs. 300/- for its protection of touch screen by applying glass and rubber back cover from local as it was not available online at that time.  
Headset are not included in the box, one has to purchase it own. I had purchased two times, but does not satisfied with the quality. Company should provide the good quality headset along with mobile like the Samsung company do. The headset of Samsung company is awesome.  
Rest, I understand now is that Lenovo gives a new offer to the market every after one month.  
It keeps surprising.  
But, I think, they should give the user a complete bundle of package like, Headset Protection Glass Back Cover and a good battery backup.  
Then it will be world's best company in this price range. 
 I just bought Lenovo A6000 plus few days back, and it got delivered on last day, though the phone seem good for money in terms of design and other features, i am very much disappointed with the performance. First of all I was trying to register on first use and it was not working properly, the phone is taking too much time to charge to 100 percent, and the phone is getting switched off every now and then. In the last 24 hours, the phone was switched off for 5 times without any warning or anything, and everytime we have to remove the battery and put it ON to switch on the phone. It is really annoying. I am planning to exchange the phone through Flipkart, while I was searching over google i found out there are many pieces with the same issues. So be careful while buying this phone. I am really disappointed. 
 The phone heats up like a furnace and restarts due to excessive heat.
Please be careful as Flipkart did not replace the phone in spite of having these defects. 
 the phone looks so cool and configuration os also superb!!! but coming to the performance(hard ware) the phone is overheating and temp suddently rose to 57 degrees speakers(load) implies the dolby trade mark but output of the sound get quenchy..with these problems faced, i have sent back to flipkart to replace the other one hoping for the good piece 
 Incoming calls volume is very poor compare with other mobiles. Other remaining features are good. volume feature is not attractive. 
 No need to do R&D like an I phone for 7,500 /- , simply superb specs for this price ... Every rupee is worth-full unless u get a Defective piece :P...  
Pros...
Affordable price ( with all the specs required by a common user )
Light weight ( single hand operation )
Long battery life & looking bright @ 0 brightness ( even though 2300 mah )
Faster ( with 2 GB ram )
For 7.5k we can use it for 1 year or less & can go for another one @ that time ( which we cant do if u buy an apple or samsung for 50k ) 
Cons....
No Notification Light ( its mandatory Now a days )
Gorilla Screen ( so that we can use it roughly )
No head set ( even though Lenovo headsets r useless :P )
Build quality looks poor & sensitive if u observe with out back panel 
Anyway.. its a good buy for 7500 @ present... go for it asap.. otherwise another will come in a week with better specs and better price :P :P :P.....  
 Got my phone on 3rd nov 2015.excellent delivery from flipkart.. This phone is not that amazing.. Ok agree price is less n specifications are good. But I am facing over heating problem on calls.. (No games played as yet) also there is a major issue with Call.voice is not clear at all on both the ends..distraction on fluctuating voice..i would recommend rather go for samsung or sony.. Lenovo is not the choice despite of specifications provided.. Camera quality is worst as compared to other phone of the same range.. Its a BIG NO to lenovo 
 Delivered within one day with decent price....Mobile is slim with 2GB RAM , 16GB ROM very good....Now upgraded to Android 5.0 Lollipop...is working fine 
 I like this phone. very good phone under 7.5k. But Bluedart courier very pathetic

 mobile complaint ravatam natural but bad servicing profile vunna mobiles use cheyalem kada,i am preferred to many my friends this mobile,but now i am told them apolozy  
 Hi, 
This is regarding the phone Lenovo A6000 plus which I bought from flipkart on 21nd July 2015. From the first day itself I got problem with touch screen and the speakers as well. I have already spoken to flipkart technical support team and they asked me to follow trouble shooting steps. After doing all still I am getting problem with touch screen and speakers. Technical department saying we cannot do anything, you need to take that phone to Lenovo customer service center. At the moment where I am living there are no Lenovo service centers. 
As I am eligible for a replacement why they are asking me take this faulty phone to Lenovo service center. 
In this issue I am not at all satisfied with flipkart. With this ridiculous customer service from flipkart I am decided not to buy any products from flipkart. 
After 20days i received replacement phone Lenovo A6000 Plus from Flipkart long arguments with customer service. I am getting the same problem with touch screen and speakers. I don't know why flipkart is selling faulty phones.  
Please DON'T buy Lenovo A6000 Plus.  
Pros: Design, Less weight,Specs
Cons: Speakers, Touch Screen, Camera, battery heating.  
 it works fine...nice phone in handsome amount. battery is ok. camera is superb....and comfortable to you...in simple words the best phone in its range,......................... 
 i have purchased lenovo a 6000 plus 15 - 20 days ago first it was working smoothly but after 15 days its touch screen is not working properly 
 Dear After 2 month my touch pad is not working proper so kindly be ready if you have purchased a phone because this phone have genetic problem of touch, as service center person also agree that this issue is regular after few month. 
 i used this mobile for two months initially the camera is good but later clarity become dull specially front camera otherwise this is super for this budget 
 This is my 2nd Lenovo. Thought I was disappointed with Lenovo service for my 1st phone of different model, I still took a risk and bought this one.
I do not have any complaints about this phone.
Its performance is good, Real Racing and Asphalt 8 run well with no lag, thanks to quad core CPU and 2 GB RAM. Doesn't heat up.
Camera OK. 
Two things they could improve upon - 
1. Battery with more capacity. Current one drains to roughly 50% after 2 hr of heavy usage. (some people may feel this is a problem , not me)
2. Vanilla/Stock Android would be better instead of Lenovo's own VIBE UI. 
 I had been using this mobile since 25 days & my view is 
1) Mobile is very light in weight and pretty slim. Design is not poor but satisfactory.
2) Display is great: HD, 294 PPI, very nice indeed. Also the brightness is higher, making it easy to use in sun light.
3) Sound quality is superb. Best in class.
4) RAM, Storage, MSM8916 chipset and Adreno graphics are wow factors for this price range.
5) Rear camera is good but not the best, low light pictures are often blur. Front 2 MP camera is very good.
6) Battery lasts really long. Whole day on WiFi and 20% remaining.
7) Other good features are SD card support, 4G, VIBE interface and noise cancellation mic. 
Heating is there but I don't call it overheating because this kind of near 40 deg celcius is there in many mobiles, that's not a problem because mobile heats only during gaming and while charging. (like any other mobile) 
Gorilla glass cannot be compensated by a screen guard. The only slacking feature.
The non-back lit type touch buttons are rarely non-responsive. 
thanks! 
 -The mobile camera quality is very bad.
-The User interface is very bad.
-The built in quality is worst.
-After using it for 2 weeks it shows the charging issue,it stop charging after 40%.
-There is no ear phone with this mobile.
-Sometimes when you restart the mobile it shows no network,u have to change the network setting every time u restart the mobile.  
 Using last one week. No lag either in touch screen or in processing speed. Screen is quite bright. Battery last for 12-16 hour. (two times charging required in a day with moderate usage of internet browsing, music and call) 
 The phone is awesome.Price is too economical.No heating problem.4GB RAM making all the apps working in a smooth manner.Good spend of money. 
 I am writing this review after using it for more than one month. This phone is a totally a value for money phone.the display of the phone is really great and it performs well in any situation whether playing a graphics intensive games or watching Full HD video. camera quality is not bad either but not best. Dolby speaker quality is very good and while on earphone the sound quality is just awesome. Battery backup is around 1.5 day on a normal usage.
But there are some problem like:-
it gets heated up , although not much while playing games , and in normal usage it doesn't heated up at all.
one more weird problem is that ...sometime it get stuck and nothing work for a few seconds .hope this will be fixed once it get lollipop update. 
 i bought this phone 2 months back and its working really good no lags till now. ram is speen enough for multitasking and camera is good too. battery life in 16 to 18 hrs tats approximately one busy working day with net always on. 
 Light weight, looks slim, great features & affordable price makes this a masterpiece
Got this phone in App offer at 6299/- even more happy for it as its original price is 7500/-
Already recommended this to my friends and family
Without a doubt can have this as a budget phone with all required features 
 GOT IT FOR 7500 and intime delivery.. there are so many options for taking a pic. im nt able to take the quality pic since 1 month i buy.. does this ph hv really gud cam qual or im lagging in settings..

guds.. price..features..dolby sound,.4g..more intrnl my..ram

 Better to update the lollypop os and enhance the battery life, Better to update the lollypop os and enhance the battery life 
 Good product in this price range... Good camera, good display sharp and bright, and also sound is very good... 
 I got a phone on my hand on 6th June, but touch is not working from today 22st June, but the phone is OK. 
 as the product is dumped with full features. great sound quality, touch and connectivity.
so far concern to storage.. they are provide very good user memory..........ram 1 GB, but it never fill u to encourage to purchase having 2 GB ram..........it fully satisfying me with 1GB ram. all the application are running smoothly.
3g/4g connectivity is upto the mark. Lenovo delivered quality product with full features.
Once again thanks to Flipkart through which I am able to purchase this product at very very attractive price. 
 Don't think too much. I compare all smartphones in this range and finally end up in this one. After one month usage, I can proudly say its a good decision. All negative reviews are fake. I did't face any major heating problem even though I'm a gamer. Battery backup is good, Moderate users can get more than a day. No lagging at all ( easy multitasking). This is the best part of this mobile because I'm a Samsung Galaxy S2 user previously. I can give this 5 star because at this cost this is the best choice.Customer service centres available all over India.
If you want to buy a 5" android smartphone under 10000, I will suggest this to all. 
 I got the phone a couple of days back and let me highlight my usage facts.  
Performance - Noticed stuttering/lagging every couple of seconds even on less intensive games such as Angry Birds, Subway Surfers and Temple Run. However the lag is less pronounced on heavy games such as Dead Trigger 2 and Riptide GP2 and hardly noticeable. The lag is quite annoying such that playing the above basic games is an eyesore.  
Display - The display is an IPS HD display (1280 x 720 - very common in these range phones) which is sharp and the brightness good enough (not too high). 
Sound - The twin speakers are quite loud enough and the sound is crisp. The Dolby effect is good for the price. No complaints here. 
Browsing - Browsing experience was smooth with the inbuilt chrome browser. 
GPS - Got an accurate lock on my location even when inside my home away from the windows. No complaints here as well. 
Camera - Average 8 MP camera which is good enough for the casual shooters but not pros. Details are not well highlighted and pictures seem to be quite saturated. Front camera is good but not great. 
Storage - This is one place where Lenovo beats similar priced phones. You get about 11.5 GB out of 16 gigs. 
RAM - This is another area where Lenovo outsmarts similar price tags. As stated, the RAM is 2 GB and you get about 1.3 - 1.4GB free RAM. 
Heating - I didn't notice much heating as many have posted. Probably, the firmware I am using (Kraft-A6000-s_S010_150515) is throttling the CPU or battery heat as was the case in prev Redmi 1s firmware. Maybe the lags in UI and games could be because of this. 
Battery - I noticed that the battery life is not bad. It lasted an average of a day's charge on normal usage with some casual gaming. May be this has to also do with some CPU throttling as stated above. 
Overall, based on my usage, if you are casual user with frequent videos/music playback and calling/ internet browsing this is a great phone for the price.  
If you are more into gaming, please avoid this phone.   
 First of all to all those spammers & fake reviewers writing about Heating issues, There is little heating which is definitely under control & it can never be considered as a drawback. 
I am writing this review after 1 Week of High Usage.Ordered this Product on 10th June & Received on 12th Early morning, so Flipkart delivery good as always ! Before talking about anything else, Let me tell you what kind of user I am becoz in the end you will prefer the phone which match your requirements not what any xyz reviewer says. Thats the approach to be followed always. 
So I am not a heavy gamer 1st of all. I do play games but not always. I listen to music, watch videos & the Most part of my mobile usage is Calling, SMS, Net Surfing, Chatting etc. 
Now come to the review things, I will rate most of the important aspects within 5. 
1) CAMERA (Primary 8 MP , Secondary 2 MP) :- In Camera section I would say it gives you a decent experience, pictures come out to be nice. However i would consider the Primary Camera as not good as expected. Though the size of images which it captures is above 2 MB, but whenever We try to zoom it on a Computer Screen the pixels get blurred after applying 3XZoom. However the color reproduction is nice & pictures are detailed. All this is about Daytime Images, while in Night it does decent job but in indoor condition with low lighting if we flash for clicking a pic at larger distance the Pics are VERY POOR 
Talking about Selfi Cam, some times it Feels It gives better experience than the primary one. The Secondary camera is a 2 MP shooter which does a nice job. 
Overall for Camera Section I will give : 3/5 for Primary & 4/5 for Secondary Cam. 
2) BATTERY : For many people, battery is very major aspect of mobile usage. The battery in device does an awesome Job. Talking about my experience when I am fully connected to internet using net based apps, a full 100% charge battery gave me a backup of 16+ Hrs. I WAS CONNECTED TO WIFI FOR THE WHOLE 16 HRS CONTINUOUSLY. Also I played games, listened to music, done calling. 
If we do normal calling say (10-12 Calls a day) + Music/ Videos (1 Hr) + Net Surfing/Chatting (2-3 Hrs) + Gaming (15 Min to 30 Min), then the battery is expected to give 15-17 Hrs of Backup. 
The Standby Time is surely above 20+ hrs, which include only Calling of few calls a day. Would give 4.5/5 for the Battery 
3) Sound Quality, Voice Call Quality, Ringtone Volumes : The Call quality for Voice calls are good. Also the speakers gave a very nice experience while playing games or listing music on speakers & making loud speaker calls. Also the Ringtone Volume is decent, not much Loud but its OK.
4/5 for this Section. 
4) Gaming : Though I am not gamer but still for testing I tried Asphalt 8, Mordern Combat 5, Real Cricket, Death Shooter 2, Hill Climbing, Temple Run, Subway Surf. I have to say all the games were running very smoothly on this device. Somewhere the 2GB RAM has huge impact in good gaming exp on this Phone. However Playing games produced a little heat up near the camera (little not too heavy) & also battery drainage is high when we play heavy games. 
Will give 3.5/5 for this Section. 
5) Processing, Touch & Internet Apps Usage : It comes with Chrome & UCB pre-installed. The internet surfing on this device is excellent. Pinch to Zoom feature works absolutely fine and websites load quite fast. Also the chatting using skype, messanger,whatsapp run very smooth. The touch is indeed very responsive & all apps run smooth. Even tried whatsapp,skype & messanger Voice Calls, all ran perfect on this Device. 
Will give 4/5 in this section. 
6) Looks,Design,Build Quality : This looks a pretty premium phone with very minimum rounded edges. The build quality is great and it supports 5 point multi touch. The only drawback in this section is the absence of Backlid menu buttons & LED Notification light. 
Will give 3.5/5 in this Section. 
7) Headphones,OTG,Charger : The phone doesnt comes with a headfone, but on listing sounds in headphones the phone does a quite remarkable Job. Also the Phone at present doesnt support OTG but I dont think I am going to use any OTG Pendrive in near future so it doesnt bother me. I got a white color USB Charger which seems to be OK type.  
Will give 3.5/5 in this section. 
Thats all from my side. I have been using this phone & I am very much satisfied with its performance apart from primary camera (not bad but not very good too). My Overall rating would be 4/5 for this Phone. 
PS : The phone got very very heated on 1st Boot but since 2nd Boot there never came any such issue :) 
Remember while buying phone take helps of reviews for getting to know about features & cons. However buy phone as per your requirement only as If I like Chocolate Icecream doesnt mean you will do the same.   
 UI is not good but works fine. Camera is very nice in this price range. 2GB RAM and 16GB Internal Memory is awesome. Working perfectly so far. Overall Good Phone.
No Earphone. 
4.5/5 for Phone.
I would gove 5/5 if UI is changed and Earphone provided. 
 Its an awesome... using it since 1 months.. no issues at all...
battery life is awesome.. mine is not even lagging.. does not gets heated... front cam is awesome... flash light is great too... feels light and good... totally satisfied.. 
 Very good specs...
Speed 9/10
Sound 9/10
Touch 8/10
Battery 8/10
Display 8/10
Front camera 8/10
Rear camera 6/10 
Good phone for Gaming & Multitasking...
Sound quality is fabulous with Dolby sound effect, Just love the sound effect.
Even with 2G net is faster than 3G of another mobile...
Value for Money of 16gb ROM & 2 GB RAM...
This is a master piece from lenovo. incredible mobile for just 7500 bucks.
Just have to give headphone / handsfree with handset... 
Nice phone overall... 
 I bought this mobile in the first flash sale. Almost 50 days completed. So far so good. I dont face specific issue. No heating problem as i don't do excessive gaming. But I play. Battery life is decent compared to my Samsung S3. Twice my phone was off abruptly as the phone was dropped by mistake. Still started working normally. I have all major required apps downloaded from play store. If anybody face battery draining fast, please revisit your apps and the memory it consumes. Move the apps to memory card. I find this a good deal and with in my budget. It is a good mobile and you shall go for it. 
 1. UI is non responsive 
2. Heating issue
3. Internet does not works most of the time 
I will suggest customers dont buy this phone because you will suffer like me. I wasted 7.5K and i hope i can save others money . 
 i have a lenovo a6000+
bought on 18/5/2015 after 16 days my phane is hang and restart automatically, hard heating issue and battery consume very fast like after 3 hours battery remaining 13%.
so phone is very bad
dont buy this
and 
 this is my first SMARTPHONE by which i m really satisfied,
camera is best & speakers also. i would prefer this if i were u.
just go for it 
 I have purchased first smart phone ever, with less budget and more feature. I have used this phone since 1 month . I found Pros 
1). very handy and lightweight ,easy to carry and operate. 5' screen size is awesome.
2). battery backup is good , as I am average user , need charge on alternative days. 
3). UI is smooth and responsive.
4). price is justified with features.  
 I have been using since last 10 days, what i noticed is battery is not lasting more than 6 hrs, heating problem also there if you use mobile continuosly. Sometimes phone is getting automatically switched off. 
Camera is good both front and rear. Phone performance is ok. 
 THE PHONE IS A MASTER PIECE ACTUALLY........2GIGS RAM AND PROCESSOR IS SUPER FAST......awesome thing at this price...... but it should have a headphone and better BATTERY 
 This is my review after 15 days of usage of this mobile... Very Best mobile i have ever bought... decent 8mp camera quality, good battery backup, mainly this comes with 4G capability which made me more happier, display quality is also good, decent value of 2 GB RAM makes it work in great speed and no lagging atall. call quality is also good. charging seems to be taking some extra time... i have read lots of charging issues in user reviews but i am not experiencing such problems... overall great... I think it more worthier than 7500 what we are paying... 
 I purchased A6K+ on flipkart electronic sale with free airtel 4G sim at Rs.6750/- 
Initial Impression->
* No headphone in the box
* Good quality of screen guard available inside the box
* The phone is light weight & back cover is matt finish which is good to handle
* First time boot is taking little bit time
* After starting the phone got system update which is good to see
* Display is very clear & vivid and supports 1080p videos
* No glass protection(ex. gorilla) but still i m not getting any scratches on screen after rough use
* 16 GB internal memory(accessible up to 12 GB)
* 2 GB RAM good for multitasking
* 8 MP rear camera is above average & front 2 MP is good
* Battery backup is descent, taking time to charge
* Sound volume is low but it is very clear because of DOLBY feature
* Not found any heating issue, but when charging charger is heating
* HD games played smoothly 
* Some time UI is laggy but it is ignorable 
According to rumour 5.0 Lollipop update coming June end 
Every phone in the world has at least one or more disadvantages if you looking to that then you never purchase a single phone. 
Find out your requirement and go for it 
As of now LENOVO A6K+ is best for me 
At last thanks flipkart, WS Retail & E Kart for quick service and good packaging.  
 CAMERA : first remove ur back sticker to camera and take pics it was awesome but make some settings to get a great pictures
NO HEATING PROBLEMS : even while playing game or charging no heating problem
RAM : 2gb ram was soo good no lagging at all
HANGING : NO hanging issues can use multi tasks at a time 
TOUCH : touch was so innocent and supperbbb
Display size : satisfied
NO Head phones in the box ;( 
BATTERY BACK UP was awesome stand up to 16hrs a day needed charging once in a day 
Dolby speakers was great as like JBL
16gb internal memory at this price was good 
At 7.5k price this phone is good  
 i prefer everyone to buyy this phone i hope my review is useful to u THANK YOU Flipkart ;) 
 I'm writing this review after 18 days of usage-
my first impression was just wow ..i used it for 2 days and was satisfied but after 2-3 days its started behaving badly ....like others i was having battery issues and heating problems ..i called flipkart service for about 4-6 days ..but at the end they did nothing ( said official heating tempertaure was 48 degree ) ...so after many hours of wastage ...i did many things to recover and atlast i found the solution....now to althose having problems of heating and battery issues- 
1.first of all check your system updates ( i know all of you have done this but anyways )
2.remove your sd card, back your account ,format the sd card and then re-insert it .. from my point of view the whole problem is due to sd card ( this worked for me)
..to check whether if i'm right just remove the card first and then use the device..if i'm not wrong the problem will not be faced ..then re-insert it ..u again will have the issue ...so i formatted the sd card and inserted it ..and atlast the probs is solved ...now im getting no heating issues.. hardly sometimes it get heated over 36-38 (after heavy i mean really heavy usage) ..
my advice- just charge the device when you wake up at morning and allow it to charge 100% ..(before it wopuld take about 4 hours now it should take approx2 hrs and its normal ..and no heating issues .) then use the whole day ..( i do this and use it full day i get pretty decent battery backup ..at night about 30-40 % battery is left still ) 
now review ,

 It is good value of money. Very nice mobile in terms of camera, processor, RAM,. Battery backup also good. Using lenovo A6000, A6000+ and A7000 and I will say all are nice. But at a price of 7499 only this mobile is just awesome. I will suggest to buy this one.
Pros:
1.brilliant HD display with excpetionl PPI and brightness
2.Sound is great
3.UI is awesomoe and easy to get into
4.Sound is moderate with clarity
5.Price is bang in the target
6. Extremele lightweight and classy to hold this sleep beauty
Cons:
1.battery backup might seem less if u a r a hi 3g net user. Trade off is it last 1 day with full heavy usage and 1.5+ days with moderate usage and less of internet when not in use
build quality is not that great however at this price its worth it
3.need a good cover so that the sleek beauty offers a good grip
4.camera could have been better 
 I have received this product yesterday. After one day full use my review is 5 star. I have already used many phone like Yu Yureka!,Zenfone,Motorolla E,E2,G,G2, Redmi 1 and 2S. But this phone Lenovo A6000+ is really awesome. Before purchasing this phone I read lot's of negative and positive review about this phone. But I am a mobile freek person. I think go for this phone. I didn't find any issue in this phone. 
Processor: No heating problem in 64 bit 1.2ghz Snapdragon processor
Disply: Bright and sharp display
Ram: Performance very good and also no lagging. 
I have played Ashphalt 8,in this mobile. The phone is so smooth and I didn't find any problem like heating, lagging etc. 
So, don't go for negative review. Just buy this mobile and use it with proper technic. And ofcourse Flipkart is awesome for it's quicker one day delievry. 
 Everything working fine except voice calling , i think it is mobile problem , i havnt faced it before in my old phone , if anybody facing same problem let me know ?????????? 
 PLEASE DO NOT BUY.
I have just bought a NIGHTMARE worth rupees INR. 7499/-.
Our Hard earned money is not in SAFE hands.
Still I believe customer is GOD. Only problem is, letters "G" and "D" has exchanged their places.
These guys does not have any standard modus operandi and do whatever they feel for.
My MISTAKE is I relied on this website and lost my hard earned 7499/-.
I have received a FAULTY product and there was no action against it.
My another MISTAKE is I went to Docomo and Reliance store and cut my existing Normal size SIM into micro SIM, which will be off no use, as I have to again go to Docomo and Reliance web-stores and pay and get another SIM of Normal Size.
I have examples of some office colleagues, where in e-Kart guy will come with a new Mobile and replace the faulty one. But, as per Flipkart there is no exchange facility in my location.
This is RIDICULOUS.
Same location and same premises is observing two different statement.
I strongly suggest, DO NOT BUY from this seller. 
 Not at all worth.I have ordered this item one month back. they delivered defective item(audio speaker issue) after 15 days my item got replaced. Got fully frustrated with a6000 plus 
 I m facing more then 3 complaint in this phone, 1. touch is not working properly, 2. back button not working, 3. u can not type with this keypad, not working proper. I have raised a complaint for replacing the phone from 24/5/15 till today 1/6/15 only 1 time i got a call from flipkart. I think they dont have any plan to replace, maybe some understanding with sellers...dont buy this items guys...its not worth. 
 i got the product yesterday. After using this for 10 mins this phone suddenly heated up.and unable to hold it. I raised a complain in flipkart for the replacement. They asked me to install smartchk app through which they ll monitor the battery temp. and they called me today around 7pm.by that time the phone temp is normal so they denied for the replacement and told me if the temp will cross 45c then only they ll go for the replacement. and this is confirmed by lenovo also that 0-45c will be calculated as normal temp. Then i asked them why they are not mentioning all those points? They kept silent. So think twice before u buy this product.And if u r buying then dont expect a replacement or return from Flipkart. I talked with executives Sharif,Chandra and abhijit das . They even did not listen to me n dont know manners also how to talk with customers . So be careful before u buy anything from flipkart. They will not replace for sure if u r facing such heating issue.Want to give 0 since 0 is not there giving 1 star. 
 I bought this handset few days ago. This is really not worth buying. The mobile has pathetic battery life and above all Lenovo has worst service. And not to forget that this is a joint cheating venture of Flipkart & Lenovo. Once you purchase this they will make it so difficult for you so that you stop calling service center and throw this mobile away.  
The mobile is not working and they are not ready to return or refund. It seems that Lenovo has not spent any money on R&D and they are doing this now with the real customers with the help of FLIPKART.  
Do not buy this if you do not want to be harassed. 
 Being a privileged customer I am really frustrated on Ekart delivery. When I am placing the order your mention one day delivery but once we place the order you are keep on changing the delivery dates based on your convenient then, what is the point of your reliability. See my purchase history with FK. If you act in the same way it will demoralise our interest with FK. Now I am in the confusion of cancelling or waiting. Explain the reason for delay else cancel my order with my knowledge. 
Thanks,
Ashok S  
 Today it got delivered to me. Very nice mobile and intelligent enough. For 7.5K, i would say, this is the best mobile. So far, i didn't see any drawbacks 
 Comparing it to moto e and g it is really a winner as of now will update in detail later. 
PROS:
Internet: even 2g is faster
Ram: 2 GB is awesome
Memory: 16 gb great 
Display: IPS good
Processor: 1.2 GHZ good a1.3 to 7 would have been the best.
Camera: rear is ok. cool, front is super fine. (If u zoom image it will not be good, will pixelite more with dots, which means)
UI: good but i need to adapt to this from my use of motorola mobiles. 
CONS:
No headset - you can get it elsewhere, a fit one but sound and music are awesome built in.
Display: gorilla would have been the best.
OS: Need updates for lolipop ( they said, will give in next three months, lets see)
No BACKLIGHTS ( lightings behind the the buttons when u touch them)
Battery: lasts for about 7 to 8 hours even if heavy use.
No heating problems and lagging issues. Actually there were lagging issues and heating problems in the A6000 that's LENOVO cleared went for PLUS model. If people say it is heating, they need to give at least some est to the phone. If they keep on using it, then it will become just warm only not hot.  
FINAL VERDICT: 4/5.
PLEASE GO FAR IT U will not REGRET it. WILL feel happy.
Better when compared to moto e and g and cheap phones like micromax and lava made one.
For sure best ever compared to HTC models. 
Will update more in detail after some days.   
 I have purchased so many Lenovo A 6000 handset from Flipkart.
Issues In Lenovo A6000 Plus,
Battery draining very fast 
Charging Also very Slow
Heating issue
Display is not much sharper in compression of Lenovo A 6000 
Cons in Lenovo A 6000
Can't Move some applications to sd card,
Pros
Battery is 2300 MH but really good  
 sorry guys first i give 5 star for this phone after i checked headphone its not good clear sound i return and get new product but the problem is still exist..
if i press microphone button only i can hear clear sound i am using micromax and nokia headphone...so now i am given 2 star
if i use stereo earphone that was good but microphone not clear 
if your music and game lover go for it... 
most of users said backlight issue, if you operation this phone automatically you know which button your going to use, my frnd have 10,000 rs android didn't have backlight but only 1gb Ram 8 gb internal memory 
dolby digital if you put some ear phone you can feel it crispy and clear sound separate 
most of phone front camera is not good for this price but its very good 
almost in review all discuss about plus point.. 
minus also most of use discussed but i didn't see this point
1. compass not work in this phone 
light weight phone easily work with one hand
best phone for this price 
if you like to buy small budget phone you can go for it  
already they stick one screen guard without notice that one i try to put new one so i wasted new screen guard so if you buy new one pls notice then put new one 
for camera remove that plastic transaparent sticker in backside camera lens otherwise you didn't get good image   
 first 25 days worked properly..later it starts giving issues like heating some times,while it came to heated up it starts discharging from 98% to 10% in 10min. I requested for replacement but they suggested one method for get rid of this issue temporarily. After 15 days its started same issue several times.
OS version still 4.4. I didnt have any hopes on Android L.
Except these thing every thing OK. 
 Pros :1) The phone has minimal heating on heavy usage compared to other phones under 7.5k.
 2) The front camera is nice.
 3) The phone runs effortlessly with 2GB RAM. It does not hang like the samsung phones.
 4) The battery backup is appreciable.
 5) The phone is light in weight unlike MI phones in this price bracket.
 6) The 5 inch display is great. 
 7) The phone is perfect for gamers.
 8) It has a very stylish look. 
Cons :1) Rear camera isn't that good specially if you are zooming in. The clarity decreases drastically. 
 Therefore four stars :') 
 Order Number OD103189061660957200,
Waiting from past 1 week to recieve order, Expected Delivery Date is Gone but till now no shipment information. 
Not Expected This Type of Service From Flipkart. How Can I Trust Flipkart for Future Business 
 I bought my Lenovo A6000 Plus on 1 month back,phone is except the below concerns:
1)Charging time a it taking more than hour's because of the charger.it can delivery only 1AMP
2)Discharging is very fast when you switch on mobile data/wifi ,without browsing Discharging time looks fine
3)Heating,when you browse/speck for more than an hour it is getting heated 
 Hi I purchased lenovo A6000 Plus from flipkart last month. after few days of usage, i realised that the touch pad is not working properly. so i contacted Flipkart. They have given some solution through phone. but afetr some failure attempts, they accepted to replace with a new one. 
My view about online electronic shopping is,
If your problem is genuine, definately they will help.
You must have all the accessories includes the box. 
Thank you flipkart. 
 Last few days I observed the phone is turning off (swith off mode) by itself while on standby. The power on operatioon thereafter is not happening with the power on button. I am forced to remove the battery and place it back and then the power on button responds,
this is major technical problem, now applied for replacement
let see I will update afterwards
and the problem found by others too if you go through reviews you will see 
 1) Guys this phone is really a Battery eater...
bought this few 2 days back....
Earlier I was using A6000...
Only dis-adv as per my opinion is its Battery.
It is getting drain so quickly...dnt know why....most of the time I have to put my phone in charging whether i am in office or at home. 
And phone is getting charge slowly. 
2) Another issue is- Songs Collection which I have in my Memory Card, I am not able to see those in built-in Music player...So need to go to File Browser to play those..and that to ony by one...while playing in this way you can't do anything in your phone...if you try..then music will stop.  
Rest featues are working fine...happy tat 
 I have bought this phone and friends this are my experience. 
Good Points of phone 
1) Nice Speed
2) Good RAM (more than 1.25 GB is free)
3) Good Storage (you get 11GB+ in phone to use, so download many apps and enjoy)
4) Gr8 Flash light  
Not so Bad Points of phone 
1) No Handsfree with phone is provided.
2) Camera quality is normal 
3) Accessories like Flip Coer is not easily available
4) Charging Takes approx 2-3 hours to get fully charged. 
My Verdict in this range best phone so far. 
 the mobile is heating continuously upto 50 degree celcius.
i am also unable to hold the mobile in my hands as it becomes very hot also in standby mode. 
 it is an average product..not good looking at first view...screen also dull comapre to other phone..i not support this product at this category..it is too.... high price for this product.. 
 I was purchased this mobile after analizing the phone such as honour holly , Red mi 2 , Moto g 2, Azus and finally i have selected this , I am really happy i was taken a good decision I am using this mobile for the past one week . I am fully satisfied with this mobile performance, In the review peoples given cons like no OTG, no key backight LED , camera quality avg . but this many features for this cost forgo's all the cons  
1. Battery is excellent (2days for avg user ) and 10 hrs for heavy users (Wi Fi , game , Video etc)
2. Fast performance even browsing and while playing games without hanging issues.
3. display quality is good.
4. good look and light weight.  
 This is the Best Budget Smartphone from Lenovo. I am very Happy to get it. This is dam Slim and Very Light Weight Phone and it Fits Perfecty in One Hand. It has Good Display, Better Sound with Dolby Digital Plus, Good Performance, and Very Smooth Touch Experiance. Guyz, Don't wait..... Juss Buy it Now.......!!!... :) :) :) 
 Guys... A genuine review from my side...
Firstly, at this price point Lenovo is providing a great piece of hardware in this device. I bought this phone during the Flash Sale period i.e. 28th April 2015.
Till date there is no lag what so ever... and the 2GB RAM makes it lag free n the humongous 16GB Internal Memory relieves you from transferring media, photos, etc to Memory card for making free space on internal memory.
- Touch responsiveness is too good.
- Display of the phone is vivid and colour reproduction is quite decent.
- Camera is decent enough... Rear 8MP camera is good.. Front camera is average... but manageable for Selfies & Skype calls.
- Capacitive buttons are not backlit, but that's understood for a budget smartphone.
- No hands-free provided in the box... Audio output is very good if you are having a good pair of headphones, thanks to the Dolby Digital Plus Sound.
Till now I didn't find any noticeable con in this device.. May be you can consider no support for USB OTG-On the Go as one of the cons.
If you are thinking of buying this device... you shouldn't be waiting... Only wait till the next Flash Sale ;)
Last but not the least, Flipkart's service as usual is too good, got the delivery the very next day :)  
 First flipkart delivered it in 20 hrs 
I have been using it for 2 days, till now there has been no drawbacks except no earphones with it. Best thing is it is very light weight and comes with free screen guard. 
Camera quality is not up to the mark. 
Also found out that features are somewhat similar to some costly Smasung Phones (like Galaxy E7) 
 i have been using the phone for the past 24 hrs and so far I think it is the best you can get in it's price range. The only niggle is it does not ship with a headset so you'll have to buy one separately.  
Pros: 
Excellent Specs for the price
Fast
Light
Good Quality Sound
Excellent Display
Excellent call quality
Decent build quality for the price  
Cons:
Nothing really to complain about. Although the UI might take some getting use to and i wish the button were backlit. 
OVER ALL AN EXCELLENT PHONE. I WILL HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT   
 Decent phone for 7.5k ! 
Amazingly light weight ! 
Have to mention the following :
It lacks a back-lit display and feels a bit laggy when opening a few apps, even though it has "2GB RAM" ! 
No headphones in the box.
No USB-OTG.
The back cover has a resemblance to Nokia Lumia phones !
And have to mention the crazy "File manager". 
The UI isn't really that great , Most options seem crammed in the corners. You can easily notice this when you want to close all open applications. 
 Got The Mobile with in 2 days .It's Good.I had Charged Full Battery.from morning 8.00 Am On wards's the battery getting discharged quickly now it's 10:08 Am .Now my battery as 86 % without any using of apps..If You are a Person in Travelling Field.Don't Go For This mobile.and No Head-set with in the box.If u need battery Backup u go for a7000...This Is My First Purchase on FlipKart. Disappointed with that.. :(
Thank You.. 
 relieved this product easily and only one day after I am sorry to say - this product is not up to the mark. touch screen is very poor, very light weight hand set but handset become very hot in few minutes of use.... hopeless return policy. seller given msg to me from flipkart that this product can not return. I am suggesting you people please do not buy this product... 
 i bought this phone after reading its features, but when i got the phone i was very disappointed on the battery front. the battery backup is all time low. takes more than 6hrs to charge and lasts only 8 hrs in standby. overnight if the phone is not used then next morning the phone will be in switched off. 
Flip kart request you to kindly do not fool any more costumers and loot the general public as already done.   
totally satisfied...highly recommended !!!!
""U should have to clean the ram for battery and heating issue...""
LOLLIPOP update is awesome...just after update make a factory reset to resolve the whatsapp contacts issue..
very good specs...
rear camera -7/10
front camera- 8/10
vibe ui- 8/10 after lollipop 9/10
antutu benchmark score is 21098..
cons...
the icons of the vibe ui like cartoon characters..
otg not supported..
minimum ek headphone to dena chahie tha..
screen is sticky type...finger impression becomes visible
battery bohot loss hoti hai....with in 3hrs 
 I have bought Lenovo A6000 plus.. few days back from flipkart but after using it I REGRET buying it. Except the Vibe UI smoothness ,16 GB memory nothing is good in this phone. After the new OTA firmware update I am facing this problem...
1. phone heats up continuously.
2. SIGNAL strength not stable ,. I have to refresh my network now and then. 3G,4g is not stable (you will be frustrated for sure)
3. Both the CAMERAs was just ok. But after the update ... noisy photos in every condition. (UNBEARABLE). Video recording is noisy and poor . TOO BAD for a price Rs 7499/- .Even Lava and Micromax gives much better results in this price range. 
DO not waste your money.... go for other brands indeed.  
 not good camera resulttttt all our ok but camera show 8 mp but i am not satisfy with result of rear and font both of camerass 
 i am planning to connect ups battery with my lenovo a6000 +, its sounds funny but this is only way to keep this crap in on condtion ,the worst battery backup i ever had in my life tym its totally bullshit... ******* i have planned to keep this phone in museum for upcoming Smart phone user generations actually i planned to give 3.5 stars but only cuz of battery back up i giving 1..... if anybody plans to buy this mobile also be prepared to buy a Ups or separate power generator along with this...  
note : best way 2 keep ur phone battery up kindly construct a POWER STATION so u can get a surplussed current. 
 I purchase the mobile after 34 days touch not working,I visited servicing centre ,they have repaired the mobile. 
I have not checked properly the mobile, they have made it like specimen phone inside. 
Do not buy this phone lenovo a6000+ 
 i ma using this phone from last 4 months. very much heating problem. some times hanging phone and average backup 
 Superb phone. 
Superb performance 
Good camera 
Great sound quality 
But, battery does not last for 4 hrs even in normal usage. 
Also heats up occasionally. 
 battery gets very high heat.... 
lenovo sucks.... 
pl think and review 
not up to the mark
.... please think of it  
 i bought the phone a week ago. and it is heating up like an IRON BOX and the battery backup is terrible it cant keep the charge for an hour. i asked for a refund but they keep saying they would call me back but they never do. so my request never buy this phone. 
 The Phone I got has serious battery issues. I have asked for a replacement and it is 4 days now when they got back to me. One, it takes a day to charge. After it charges, battery does not last for more than 5 hours. And I am not using it mind you. This woman tells me to use a different charger. For god sakes,I am patiently explaing, even after 100% charge, the battery is not lasting. She said she will send a link....till the time of this post...I have not received. Called up the call center, that guy was not in his elements. I don't want to comment on his state of mind. I am a Mangalorean. Have little patience a stiver for excellence. Have so much work to do......Now I have to figure out what to do with this guys....Have been shopping with them for sometime....but this experience is getting distateful :( 
 I am using the mobile last 7 days. But experience is NOT good. 
1. Internet is too much slow. (While I am using same sim card in my Samsung mobile which is with 1GB ram, internet speed is quite good than lenevo of 2 GB)
2. Call divert option is not there.
3. You can not download two app simultaneously from Play store.
4. When phone is in loudespeaker, voice is breaking.
5. Copy paste is NOT working from places.
Many others issue I have faced. You should go for Moto G instead of that mobile. 
 Never purchase  
Bad: Not providing earphone set. 
I am satify the touch screen........................................................................................................................................  
 I Am using this phone since last 7 month, it is excellent phone in low range, just buy it , i love lenovo phone. 
 I buy this mobile.This is very nice and fast mobile.This mobile is no hang.It battery is good power.This screen touch is very fast.I advise to all people that buy this mobile because this is no hang,heat. 
 The Phone spec is really very good, speaker phone is not audible, the ring tone also mild intact missed many important calls, from phone book you can not dial directly, you need to search contact's using dialler.  
Suggestion to lenovo - don't make mobile phone with back speaker, the speaker is not audible when you keep it on the table you need to keep up side down ( screen on table top). 
 i purchase lenovo 6000 plus problem was display touch screen cur cur noise & flipkart team not support 2 Hours talk to customer support team but issue not solve 
 Display damaged, Touch very hard, battery drain very fast, Heating Problem , Dual sim function not working properly, no contacts ring tone 
 worst product .... automatucally switched off ... many times...dont buy this.....totaly fed up with this phone 
 Battery backup of this phone is very much less.on standby mode only 12 to 14 hour.other then battery the phone is ok ok.only issue is battery backup...i am disappointed with backup. 
 EXCEPT FRONT CAMERA & DUAL SPEAKER, REST IS FINE. SPECIALLY WITH LOLIPOP OS, PHONE BECOMES MUCH SMOTHER 
 Specifications are good but phone use to hang everytime. If i want to make a call you just have to touch 4-5 times. Too bad phone.dear Lenovo, never expected a bad product from u. 
 nice looking light wieght and performance is too good so i suggest to every one for purchased it and then fell the andriod world in your hand 
 The battery is getting drained out at a rapid rate even just 1.5 months after purchase.Even after full charge the charge is going to 0 % after just 6 hours..
Also data cable given is loose connecting with the phone socket. 
 First of all , Flipkart delivery rocks . Phone was delivered within 24 hours . Now coming to the phone . 
DISPLAY:4/5 Display clarity is nice . Colour reproduction is good and the sunlight visibility is also ok. 
CALL AND SIGNAL QUALITY:2.5/5 This is where the phone fails . Signal clarity is a bit poor and I did face some call drops . This is not expected drom a brand like Lenovo . Also voice call clarity is pretty much average nothing bad , nothing great. 
PERFORMANCE: 4/5 The Snapdragon 410 chipset does its job well. However , one thing I have noticed is that games tend to lag once the phone heats up . This is very strange as I have an Asus Zenfone 2 Laser with the same chipset and this Asus phone doesn't have this problem . I think that this is a problem with all Lenovo phones because this same thing also happens in the Lenovo K3 Note. 
CAMERA:3.5/5 In daylight the camera is very good . But in low light pictures are grainy. In very loe lighting camera sucks. Front camera is so so. 
BATTERY:3/5 Wish Lenovo had put a 2600mah battery instead of 2300mah. Battery life is very much below average.  
BUILD QUALITY:3/5 Feels rather cheap. 
VERDICT: IF PERFORMANCE IS YOUR PRIORITY GO FOR IT . OTHERWISE SPEND SOME MORE AND BUY A SAMSUNG OR SONY DEVICE.  
 Lenovo A6000 plus Mobile is not functioning well, I have bought just 2 month back. touch screen not working properly. I have to do restart again again. 
 middle finger to those who are giving 5 star rating to this dubba product
it is heating too much & not able to hold it in hands,battery is very poor,do not buy/consider this phone to buy  
I am giving -10 rating for this product but -10 is not available so i am giving one  
 I bought this ph one month back. a very good one for the value, features are simply awesome, camera quality was even good. U can even run high graphics without any prob. antutu benchmark was also very nearer to redmi. but the main problem with this piece is that it has a habit of restarting atleast once in a week. In recent days it has been more, for every 2days it is restarting atleast once....... very disappointed 
 Super phone of 2015-16,i sell this for k3 note, but k3 note is not good against a6000+, i lost my a6000+ and money 
 THE PHONE IS QUITE GOOD . ALL THE FEATURES ARE AMAZING AND VALUE FOR MONEY ALSO. BUT THERE IS A LITTLE PROBLEM THAT IT GETS HEATED DURING PLAYING GAMES AND CAMERAQ QUALITY IS ALSO EXCELLENT . 
 hai friends 
this is problem
(this phone is charging is one day,light heating , no earphone in the box accerissiors ,one sim is 4g,another sim is only 2g,battey back up 2300mah) 
strength

Pros-
1.Got the Android 5.0.2 update on the very first day I purchased the phone. Kudos lenovo.
2.Both cameras are good not the best but for the price it's awesome. There is a blue cover in the rear camera please remove that blue cover as it spoils the camera clarity.

Thanks to Flipkart delivered the product within a day kudos to the team.Thanks lenovo and Flipkart.  
 Review after 10 day use. Battery is quite good gives 30 hour backup after continuously connected to wifi, played a 1-2 hrs games, watched videos 1-2 hrs. Phone becomes even better after update. Primary camera is so so. Secondary is good. One can easily use with one hand. Not so large but no so small. Fits completely. Sound quality is awesome. Phone heated only once or twice when I played youtube for a long period or played game for a long.Phone is sooo light that it doesnt feel if put in pocket. The only thing I miss is the notification light. Notification sounds are also very low. Its hard to be heard if a msg arrives on phone. Other than that Phone is really cool. Best in class. 
 I haven't seen any big issue with the phone for minimal usage like browsing,gaming and phone calls.
I would recommend it for people who are not high gaming users 
 bought this under a huge hype created online. Initially this seemed to be a nice product but then it started showing true colors. Life line of a smart phone i.e. "touch screen" does not work most of the time in patched. it is so frustrating when you are writing message,mail or playing games. Went to service center and they re-wrote the software but nothing changed. My suggestion pls pls pls pls do not buy this product. I also joined Lenovo community online and keep seeing ppl crying with same touch problem in community. 
 The phone is not getting charged. Battery is not charging at all. I have started using the phone and the phone has issue now. 
 very bad.....it went dead after upgrading ...very bad product...keep away ,. WE purchased it through flipkart whose service is excellent.. but the product performance is very poor and gone dead within 6 months....what a product it is 
 battery drying early and mobile is getting very heat early ... waste of product please improve the battery mah and it wil be better for the buyer . 
 I usually don't write reviews, but was forced to because of how poor this phone is and how poor Lenovo's customer service is. It has been about 3 months since I purchased this phone and I have had to take it to the customer service 5 times already! The display of the phone started disappearing from the first month itself. Sometimes the display comes back after 15-20 hours on its own! 
The Lenovo team has REFUSED to replace the phone. Now I have no choice but to at least inform/warn others NOT to buy products from Lenovo, especially this phone.... 
 This phone has worst camera as compared to other phones.If camera is not needed this phone is as good as a phone costing 
 i bought this mobile recently for few days it was working fine after that the battery drains like anything. with full chagrge it is coming around 3 hrs and if u talk for 3-5 min getting too much heat.. may be this will help you 
 If normal use with not very high end game is the requirement with a good net speed, This is the best option in this price range. However, one should understand high specs low price shall always make a mobile with poor internal hardware like, PCB, sim and micro sd card holders etc.
High performing processor is bound to emit heat. I dont think my phone would last more than 1.5 year with very moderate use..... at this moment it is 4 months old and functioning properly within satisfaction level. 
 Serious network issues with Lenovo A6000 plus. Went for service centre and the token number per day exceeds 120. So many complaints on this product and no proper service. Please dont buy Lenovo. 
 Touch never worked properly. Even replaced piece was same. Bad Camera quality. Heating Problem.
Bad Battery Backup. 
 THE PHONE IS COMPLETELY NOT CHARGING .AND IT IS COLD
IT IS POWER DOWN DUE TO 0% CHARGE.I BOUGHT IT JUST 2 MONTHS AGO 
 So, Bought this phone after looking at the specifications. Disappointed to say the least. The phones screen has stopped responding in parts, so effectively the phone is a brick. and apparently this is not the first instance for this phone. 
Never buying a Lenovo Phone again, I\d rather buy a feature phone than this stupid phone. 
 I bought the phone with good expectation of decent cam and other feature better than Redmi 1s but great disappointment as the camera is to bad and have shades and look like vga cam when zoom the cam picture... apart from cam rest all other feature seems to be good and handy.... 
 i have buoyed a product, it is not good.so many problems are come
ex-over heating, camera problem,automatic shutdown , 
 I had worst experience with lenova product, will never buy lenova phone
I bought this phone looking at his specification (Camera 8 MB, Internal Memory : 16GB).
Camera quality is very poor, worst than 5MB. I found lot of blur in images even in good light. 
I replaced phone, but again replaced phone got an flickering issue with display, camera still shown poor display. 
Inspite mobile got extra speaker , sound is not clear.
Finally I returned phone, got my cash back. Thanks flip kart for same. 
There is manufacturing defects in this phone. So, Never buy lenova phone.  
I recommend to buy REdmi 2 prime at this range with outstanding performance (using since 1 month) 
 Not sure if this is defect with phone or manuf defect, but my phone cant hold on to a reception. Keeps losing it. And camera is too quick, it manages only "shaky" pics.  
Pros: 4G works good. lovely exp with internet. As a toy, YES ! 
Cons: As a mobile, this fails. Cant handle calls. Hopeless.   
 Phone Dial take Time index, Phone Screen Auto Black 5 to 10 minute after coming screen... and very slow 
 You will never be satisfied by this mobile if you are a real or expert or knowledgeable or frequent ANDROID or SMARTPHONE user.
Don't Buy this Mobile. 
 i madhu from chennai,,,,,i purchase lenovo 6000 plus,,10 days back...i am not happy about this phone,,,,,,,,worst phone over heating ,,,,,,,,,,,,we have to cook food in tis phone top 
i dnt not except from flipkart tis type of phone,,,,,,china mobile 
 Heating problem and battery sudden reduce.sensor not working and some tines touch not responded...worst experience.. 
 Dont go with lenovo specially A6000 plus after Only 1 Month its starts heating and now take 8-9 hour for charging and battery finished in 2-3 hour, when not even using data. 
Lenovo!!! your after buy service is really bad, they dont have the spare battery for A6000 plus in service center, even want to buy. They said it took 15 days.... 
Return my money.... or change it now.... 
 after 2 months touch screen not working properly...my friends also facing same problem with lenovo 6000plus. Need to replace the touch screen for good performance. 
 First Impression of the product was very good. But after few month of use its get heating problem, Battery Problem or any kind of problem what you can think. So please Don't Buy Lenovo A6000 plus.  
I ordered two A6000 plus and with these two phone i have worst experience of my life. one is changed by Lenovo service center Jhalawar with lenovo A6000's mother board. and second one is also repaired by service center kota 5 times. but problem is still as before. 
i am giving 1 star because there is no option for ZERO. 
 Battery Backup with net 4 to 5 hour, without net 7 to 8 hour 
bad battery backup  
Galarys image not move & copy to other folder 
1 gb space Ram of lolopop so very Hang full mobile  
Lolipop version very hang full this phone 
this phone you not purchase ............ okay   
 im getting much more problem in this mobile , getting to much heat and battery is drying very fast................................... 
 Phone is awesome. Esp Red color has great look to it. Speed and UI are great. especially if you are bored of old samsung and Sony interfaces. Great price. Only a bit drawback is with camera. Rest ll is awesome nd great battery backup too 
 Fone is a good but Still it do have some Technical Problem, after 1 month of purchasing the product, technical snag developed. went to service centre, they say it will cost around 4200/-, called there customer care, got it free.... 
very big problem solved by same service centre.... 
 Good specifications but very poor performance.Battery Gone in just 2 months.Not a worthy buy.Phone hangs more.Can go for Asus Zenfone 5 or Moto G.Dont buy this shit mobile. 
 features are very good. but main problem is battery and over heating. remaining performance is excellent 
 touch screen is lagging when i touch any application it some times takes half or even one second to respond.
 whenever i tried to scroll a long list there is always a time delay in between my swiping the screen up to down(scrolling) and actual movement of screen display this is the most pathetic experience; it gives a feeling of operating a used phone(at least 5 to 7 years old).  
even my micromax canvas a1 works much much better than this as far as touch screen lag point of view is concerned. i m not satisfied with this phone. 
 I bought this piece and in the first few days itself it was hanging and sim was not getting recognised. later after rebooting as directed key pad back space is not working. contacting customer care was no use and now they want me to go lenovo centre and check it out for a brand new product. Too bad.. i will never recommend this site or phone for mobiles. 
 Touch is not working properly. 
some time a single word need to be press more than five time to get it type. 
Others are okay. 
 Touchpad became unresponsive after 1 month of use. Service center wants it to be deposited for atleast 1 month.
Also it is Full of Bugs.. 
 Please don't buy this product, it worth nothing than a cheep Chinese toy. Cheep plastic used, fragile body. 
My mobile became dumb in just 4 months. 
Thanks to Lenovo for the dumbest product.
Thanks to Flipkart for advertising it & to make a hole to customer's pocket.  
Excellent mobile light weight performance is grate , 16 GB ROM & 2 GB RAM storage capacity , Also battery capacity long time 
 First of all I really want to thank flipkart for delivering this product within 2 days.
For the product, its good. The phone is light, sleek and beautiful. The interface is very smooth and the camera quality is just Good. but battery backup is very bad. fastly finish the battery. 
 The phone is stylish and adorable for its appearance. The camera is good.Dolby speaker rocks.Affordable phone with many feature comparing to other brand android mobiles. 
 display became faulty within 2 weeks but its replaced under guaranty. now its very sensitive and very comfortable 
 Phone with 2 GB Ram & 16 GB Internal Memory with LTE Technology
Advance features in lenovo A6000, good processor, camera, Front camera for video Calling and many more. Over all very good handset in Very affardable price 
 I using the mobile for the past 1 month, it is good and charge holds for 2 days. Happy for this product at this price. Only concern is I didn't receive a head phone along with the mobile. 
 I am writing dis review after using it for 3months..dis is the best smartfon in this price category..till now m not faced any issues..camera quality is good,speed is best,there is no hanging problems..
Only 1 issue is there,whenever battery drains below 15% and u are still using it continously den sometimes it may heat. Otherwise no problem is there with this device. U can buy this without any doubt in mind. 
 Quick review just listing the problems with the set. This is a great handset in this price range.
1. Lenovo Theme store doen't have any additional themes. Have to use custom launchers for enabling additional themes. 
2.Over heating (Media Server)
Phone worked great for a week, then after adding some movies to external Memory card the phone began to heat up and temperature consistently remained above 40 degree C. Media server was taking up more than 50% of the battery as seen from the battery tab.
Deleted those MKV files and now phone is back to normal.
Ps: Disabled media storage and added gallery app and video player. 
3.Lollipop update - Currently Unavailable
Lollipop update which was released on Sept 05 was full of bugs. Waited for a month so that release is stable..but now can't find it. Waiting for Lollipop without issues. 
4.Antivirus
The inbuilt antivirus database is out of date and it wants me to pay Rs 49 for a month ?
when there are a multitude of free antivirus in the Playstore. 
 Third Class Mobile of A6000 Plus. Service was very very bad. 
Don't use Lenovo item. 
I have used A6000 Plus Lenovo. Within 3 Months , Speaker and Touch are not working 
 lenovo give good features in less price but they are compro with quality.
purchased in Dt.12/05/2015. with in 15 days its screen not work properly. flipkart check 2 to 3 times remotely and tell me our phone is okay and it have nothing any manufacturing defect.
I went to service station and give my phone after a week and they replaced the screen.
now few days ago its charging not properly. I only used lenovo charger to use the phone. but charging symbol is appear on the screen but the battery does not charge.
I went to service station and serviceman told me there problem in motherboard so they want to change motherboard of the phone.
What about the quality of lenovo. very worst quality of phone I got first time in my life.

I advice do not buy this type of phone.
Thanks. 
 Battery capacity if the mobile is too bad and camera front and back are too worse....drrrr laaga undha phone.....thokklo phone......edhava phone......choose a another brand of phone....don't buy the Lenovo mobile 
 when i share the datas via xender or playing the media file when phn is heating and show that media server is 51% and the phn hanged 
 I own a Lenovo A6000 Plus mobile. Some parts of my screen do not respond at times but after a few hours it again starts responding. This cycle has been repeating for a month. Kindly suggest me a solution and whether this is a software or hardware issue. 
 I got this mobile very recently,Wrost camera clarity and so much heat.if we expand the image what we took very blurred image it is showing up. 
 Poor quality product. Lot of issues. Camera quality is bad. Overheating. Battery draining very fast. etc etc... Not recommended product. 
 this is the worst phone i have seen ever.
do not go for this lenovo a6000plus.
Nothing is working properly.
waste mobile. 
 this is the worst phone i have ever come across. I reciceved the phone on the 1st of august 2015 and it started troubling me from the very next week. i took it to be minor problem but no..as the days went by it started to hang.. it hangs just every second it is switched on. when i took to it to the service centre i saw atleast 100 ppl with the same problem waiting before me in the line..and it is over 20days dat it is wid the service centre.
for some ppl even after servicing the problem remained as it is although i have not recieved my phone yet. so not quite sure about this point.
i seriously dont noe who all are benefitted from the phone but for sure it has worked out at all. 
 thanks you filpkart for delivering such a five star product to me.

Rating 00000000000000 
 i bought a 6000 mobile with Andriod 4.4.4, after upgraded to 5.0.2, all contacts are in the list but it didn't shows while receiving an incoming call and in applications also didn't get the contacts. most of the apps are not supported for the upgraded andriod. 
 My other friends have taken this same Lenova 6000 plus mobile from flipkart they got screen guard inside the box but i could not got the screen guard. 
 It gets hot very soon. In just 5 minutes of use it becomes very hot. And battery also last for few hours only. Does not provide headphones. Configuration details shows Lenovo A6000 only and A6000plus is missing. Do not buy this product guys....better to choose samsung...or go for moto handsets. 
 AWESOME LOOK WITH GOOD CAMERA QUALITY...BUT I'LL NOT RECOMMEND GO FOR XIAOMI or YU FOR THIS PRICE ............... 
 Using for 3 month now its becom lolopop good performance. Camera,batry,display all are fantastic. Gaming is also responsive there is no lag in hd games ..like asphat air born fifa 
 I am writing this review after using lenovo A6000 for a week.
pros:
Sound quality
lightweight
no heating issue
smooth touch 
cons:
UI is not that eyecataching
rear 8 MP is Camera is far below standards.  
I will not suggest who thinks of having lenovo A6000 with a good camera 
 Worth for Money, Hassal free upgrade to lollypop version, Excellent cameras, Nice power backup. Overall No issues in 2months usage 
 If I have to say it in one line I will say - " Buy it as soon as possible else you'll miss the golden egg". 
 a decent handset,not to shinny not to dazzling but it does has that soothing feature...display is pretty sharp and vibrant,,that 2 gb ram lets you multitask with out any lag..battery backup is also good..and you can directly install your appz and games to the sd card 
 worst phone ever..it was flawless on the frst day bt next day the touch was not working properly !
every thing was full of flaws..full of software and hardware issues !! 
plz do not go for this phone else you will regret later on,.. 
 recently i have brought lenovo 6000+ from flipkart,the flipkart service is good,but the mobile phone from lenovo is really bad.
the main issue is, its get hot within the usage of 15minutes and after that the whole battery charge drains out within 3 hours,really a big quality issue....  
 jus after one day im having problems with the touch. please dont buy. giving one rating only because i have to. lousy phone. 
 the phone is grt no doubt. but now the touchsreen is not responding at some places. i purchases it only 2 months back 
 Last friday you are delivered LENOVO mobile...after second day the speaker its not use what the problem will arise in the new moblile...you are very cheater...if you provide below low star i will give this product... 
 Except Touch remaining all are good.
Camera is also low at sunlight,but nice during night times.
Battery was awesome and heating is totally low. 
 light weight and battery backup is nice Good RAM (more than 1.25 GB is free)
Good Storage 11GB+ in phone to use Gr8 Flash light its just awesome product............................. 
 Hi Friends, I have bought this phone by flipcart. Phone is really good.
But I have face only 1 problem with zooming the captured picture, pixels got very disturbed
But clear at file manager location.
Otherwise phone is good no confession on buying this product. 
No heating issue with this phone 
 Using this device since two months . 
And this is how I feel about it now :
The first thing in noticed is that the mobile comes with a lot of bloatware ...i uninstalled many of them and disabled the rest. 
and about the mobile..... 
Unbelievably fluid performance and multitasking is a lot of fun on this device . 
No app closes automatically and always stays in RAM . So you can run all your faceook and watsapp .and whatnot ... even while playing asphalt 8 or something and no matter how much stuff you do ..you will always find more than 300MB space still lenft in the RAM.. a big thubs up for the 2 gb RAM at this price. And another big thumbs up for the responsiveness of the device. 
the next good thing is its camera . 
Believe me its camera is truly AWESOME for the photographs .. it has one of the finest 8MP lens in the market. 
Not advisable to take selfies with its 2MP camera.. but again you dont get every thing for 7.5k .. it is not that bad either .. it performs upto its standard.
but not that gud for video .. you cannot take FHD video... and the 720p video is not that good .. also it take time to adjust the focus and the video comes out to be soft. 
Batter backup is amazing .. and lasts one full day and sometimes one and half day.
now the rating:
Display : 9.8/10
Speaker output : 8/10
headphone output : 9/10
Battery : 10/10
Looks: 8/10
Responsiveness : 10/ 10
Rear camera : 10/10 ( photo) and 6/10 (video)
value for money : 11/10 
:D go for it  
 Flipkart Service IS Awesome 
BT Dont Buy Lenovo A6000+
*Heating
*Hanging
*HD games Not Run Properly Even 2GB Ram
*Battery Not up To MARK 
 i have not seen worst product than this before.it has major touch issues,lagging while gaming,heating issues and last but not least camera clarity issues.plz dont buy 
 Worth every penny! Bought this for my wife who previously used Moto E 1st gen, which was also bought on Flipkart.
Mobile is great! Camera performance is far better than many mobiles in this price range.
Performance is great with its 2GB RAM.
Display is awesome. My wife really liked it.
Only down is lack of Gorilla Glass! I'm a bit worried in this regard, as we've a 2yr old naughty kid who throws up anything and everything, and ahe has to be extremely careful to keep her mobile out of her reach!!
All other things are great though!! 
 It is having everything confined within good budget.Battery backup as well camera is good . Headphones not available is the only disadvantage .No heating and battery draining issues unless you use memory card. 
 I purchased this product from flipkart at Rs 6299/- (incl of 10% cashback). Kudos to flipkart for the delivery speed even in remote Allahabad. 
Pros: Excellent UI, no noticeable lag and ultra smooth touch interface.
Has 4G support, although not tested as there is no 4G service in my area. Presently running on 3G.
Both SIM based and Wifi speeds are superb, easy to access from the touch panel overhead with one click / touch.
Slim design, thin and fits in the hand perfectly. Most operations can be done with one hand, size of screen (5") is optimal. Brilliant display and HD video watching is fun, with the superb DOLBY twin speakers for output. Pl note that NO headphones are supplied, but display cover is included in the package.
Quick recharge, can charge to full capacity id less than 3 hrs. Battery lasts for a day with less to moderate usage.
Camera takes great pictures in good light, low light pics are grainy (at night with tube light illumination only). But the pictures are discernable, colours original. Was getting blue tinge on initial pics, then realized that the blue plastic cover on the camera glass was still there ! Post removal, colours are original, no issues.
Most apps can be moved to SD card storage, thereby freeing internal memory for phone usage. I have installed a 32 GB Sandisk Ultra Class 10 Micro SD card which works fine with this phone.  
For this price, I can challenge anyone to find a better phone today ! For budget phone seekers, do not think twice, CONS like no backlight on display buttons can be overlooked. 
Update on 09 Sep 15: One system update was received a couple of days after using the phone and certain apps were updated. I have received the OTA System update to Android Ver 5.0.2 (Lollipop) two days ago. No issues after the upgrade phone wise. However, the Mcaffee appln and Clean Master widget on screen have vanished post upgrade. I guess I will try re-installing to rectify, they work fine otherwise. 
 I have bought this phone 2 months back. I would like to give 5 points to this phone. I didn't like its interface but we can add theme to change it anyway.Below are advantages :
1) 2 GB RAM ensure this phone won't hang. I have tried playing asphalt 8 which played quite well.
2) Sound is good.
3) HD clarity is good.
4) Light weight
5) Battery backup is awesome. I watched video continuously for 4 hours which consumed my 20% of battery.(in GSM mode)
6) Pretty good for this price. 
Disadvantages : I don't have many
1) I didn't like the user interface
2)No LED light. I really don't know what it takes to add a LED light. We have to check manually if is charging or we have got any message/notification.  
 The overall performance of this phone is killing every third phone available in the market at same price. The phone worked perfect on any level of usage. It is fast, light, good looking and nice at it best. But I replaced the phone 3 times and every time I was getting defective product. First, I got phone in which after using about one month the Headset Jack gone. Second phone I got after replacement was having camera and charging issue. The third time I got the phone was having touch issue. At bottom side the touch wasn't working at all.
There is no any performance issue with the phone, but the products each time I was getting had some manufacturing defect.
Thanks to Flipkart, even after approximately 3 months, they gave me Refund.
Don't give up on bad reviews, it was my bad luck that I was getting manufacturing defects in the phone. This type of problem is very rare. Just go with this phone if you are tight on money. This phone is worth at 7.5k 
 Heating Issue .
Not only on the time of charging ,
If we use mobile for Continusly for 3 or 5 minutes - Phone gets very heat ...
During Messaging , Call etcc... 
Heating Issue ...  
WS Retail also now a days very worst ...
30 days replacment is very fraud 
 My screen shattered after a month used and the worst part OMG the screen cost 4500 bad experience with Lenovo. Never in a million years buying Lenovo products. 
 i ordered Lenovo A6000 plus i get the specifications as A6000+ but the mobile model name appeared as A6000 only.
Double Data Offer is given by Flipkart but the AIRTEL operator decline this offer due to the model name as lenovo A6000 not A6000 plus. I dont know why this offer is given by flipkart.
About mobile it is good. 
 THE BEST MOBILE FOR LENOVO SO GOO NO HANG 
CAM. IS SO GOOD SOUND IS GOOD RAM IS WERY FAST RUNNNG IN LOW BUJET PRICE 
 Within two months I am getting heating problem when the mobile is standby. This problem raising after some time so it bcoz of the mobile hardware. So dont buy and waste the money 
 still the same awesomeness after a month of usage.It's the best phone in this range.I read many bad reviews before purchasing,but i still bought it as it's Lenovo and now i don't have any kind of problems.so please,don't be afraid by reading bad reviews and if receive a faulty device,flipkart has very good service for returns. 
 Bought this phone last month in july 2015.My cousin and some other relatives have
Lenovo A6000 and when I saw it's specs better than and in an offer from flipkart,
I was getting this for same price, so i ordered it immediately.
Now let's see Pro's and Con's: 
PROS:
1.Display(4/5): 5 inch IPS HD Display does it's work perfectly.At this price, u will get a 
crisp and clear picture quality.Watching HD or Full HD videos on this is a pleasant 
experience.It has light sensor, so in Auto mode, it works in sunlight as well.It looks 
delicate so i have applied the screen guard that came with package and a back cover
that i purchased from market.It doesn't have Backlit LED nor LED notifications, which I 
had in my Sony Xperia GO, so it was a little discomfort in beginning but now I have got 
used to it. 
2.Camera(4/5): It comes with 8MP back and 2MP front camera.There is a LED flash for back camera.
The 8MP back camera takes decent pictures, flash helps us take balanced pictures.I didn't notice any overlighted area. You can't compare it to I-phone camera, but yes it does a good work at this price.
Front camera is very good in quality.Even with 2MP resolution, it captures clear and sharp pictures.
The camera has many good features like HDR, Histogram, Different Focus modes, Redeye reduction etc.
It can shoot HD videos, that i think is sufficient bcoz Full HD will take extra space on storage.Quality of it's video is also up to the mark. 
3.RAM and Processor(4/5): It has 2GB RAM and 1.2Ghz Qualcomm snapdragon quad core processor.
I have tried games like temple run, Subway surfer, candy crush.I am not a hard core gamer, but this games work flawlessly.I tried multi tasking like gaming, surfing and watching videos together without killing any apps and it didn't hang for a moment. So a good one for this price. 
4.Connectivity(3.5/5): It is dual SIM.First slot supports upto 4G and Second slot upto 2G.
Both are micro sim.I live in Indore, where there is no 4G but 3G and 2G worked very well.
Sometimes when I turned on Data, it turns on, but no data transfers, so I have to turn off and turn on again.
Call quality is good and signal receptions are also strong. 
5.Storage(2/5):Lenovo is giving an internal storage of 16GB and good thing is whole space is available for apps and all stuff.
It can expand upto 32GB, means you can have over 45GB space.But there is one bad thing about phone that will come in 'Cons' section. 
6.UI(4/5): It has Android Kitkat 4.4.4 running with Vibe UI, which is smooth and user friendly.And with this RAM and Processor, it works really well. Lenovo has promised to release lollipop Update for it. Lenovo has released some updates, but i suggest to take some time before downloading any updates, because some updates may disappoint you.  
7.Battery(3/5):It has 2300 mAh replacable battery, which once charged upto 100%, gives me a backup for whole day, with average use like surfing, playing games, watching videos.I turn on data, only when i need it, so it may vary from person to person.In idle condition, battery drop is 1-2% in 2hrs, which is good. 
8.Sound(3/5): Though Lenovo is giving 'Dolbi Digital' technology for sound, but i didn' feel
anything extraordinary about it.Two speakers at back side do their work well and are loud and clear enough to hear in a crowded and noisy environment.They have not provided Earphone with this, so i purchased Senheiser's earphone that works well with this.Watched movies and found the quality decent, not as good as my last Sony Xperia GO 
CONS:
With so many good features and hardware it has only one major Con that troubled me a lot and that is HEATING.When i searched, i found that almost every person having it, suffering from same problem.
I also complained flipkart about this issue and asked for replacement, but their answer was "It is normal for this phone to heat upto 48degrees and unless it is upto that temperature, we will not replace it."In user manual, came with phone, it is mentioned that don't operate it above 42degree, So their excuse is totally unacceptable.
So I searched more and found that when I unmount my 16GB class 10 memory card, the heating issue is gone and this is the reason, i gave 2 out of 5 for Storage, When u can't use expandable memory what is the use of it.Looks like, I am using a Pen drive.The reason for this is, their ROM is not able to manage 'Mediaserver' app effectively,
when i checked, i found it was consuming 80% of battery, which is not more than 5& in other phones.One solution i found for this issue, is putting a .nomedia file on your memory card and then use it.In this case some apps will not show content of memory 
card, but this is how u have to use it. 
So overall a good phone for 7.5k, with only one major drawback, HEATING.May be in future updates, they will resolve this issue and the phone will be perfect.  
 This is the worst mobile and waste of money.
it does not work properly and service is very bad. 
It works automatically, touch is very bad and this phone has manufacturing defects.
company increase RAM & internal memory in its old mobile A6000 only. 
 Great Device Totally in Love with my phone no lag no heating .. long lasting battery.... fast and fluid performance i suggested this device to my friends now 4 of us using this device and coming to camera Good Picture Quality and HD Video Recording.. Totally my rating is 10/10 :D 
 I bought this phone from flip kart. I am satisfied with features of phone at this price.
But after few days the phone start getting shutdown automatically. To start the phone again I have to remove and plug the battery every time. the phone will be shutdown atleast two times in a day. 
Later I came to know one of my friend also bought this phone from shop by paying 200 more than the flip kart price. He is not having this problem with phone. 
I feel flip kart is selling faulty product. please be careful. 
 Superb phone for this price. 
PROS
*Weightless
*Very slim 
*Played Asphalt 8 in this phone for 10 min, doesn't heat too much, no lag
*Sound quality in the speakers and earphones are really good, speaker produces very good sound *Good color saturation in screen, 
*Pics taken in 8 MP Camera is good  
CONS
*Charging is a bit slow with the given charger ,takes 2 to 2.5 hours for full charge
*Has 2G/3G/4G in one sim slot and other slot has only 2G
*No notification LED
*No back lit for back button and menu button (below) 
Overall verdict:The phone is a worth the money device for its specs and price. 
 Lenovo a6000 Plus is Very Good phone.
Pros-
1.Fast Processing and Good storage, no lags
2.Good Front and rear camera.
3.Excellent Sound Quality earphone, speaker, Dobly feature is awesome.
4.Good battery backup. lasts for a day with moderate use
5.HD display is amazing.
Cons-
1.Takes 2- 3 hours to charge completely which is huge 
Right now the the phone is operating under kit Kat 4.4, which is basically a 32 Bit operating system, This means the Snapdragon "MSM8916 410" processor which is 64 Bit processor, is not performing optimally on this phone, once the phone is upgraded to the "ANDROID LOLLIPOP", which is a 64 Bit operating system,The performance of this phone is expected to rise up to 20% to 30%. Which is a very very good thing by the price factor of this phone. 
 I have purchased Lenovo A6000 Plus from Flipkart on Jun 24th 2015, The day I got my mobile I had experienced heating problem. And from last two days it is not working(Just a blank screen). When I am trying to call the Toll Free number that is mentioned on the mobile pack is not working and the service centers that are available in internet are all fake numbers. It shows the intension of Lenovo. Please do not buy any Lenovo products from Flipkart. 
 facing in this hanset heating problem, when phone is heat you are not to do any thing that time, not satisfy. 
 I have been using the product for a month and from the first week onwards i am facing problems..The back cover of the phone slips out from the phone.The phone has connectivity issues over wifi,the speaker is out of service from the 2nd week,Phone gets heated badly during first charging,phone gets restarted frequently while using share it sync it apps.
I requested a return of the product and flipkart accepted to replace me the product..What is the benefit in getting the worst phone again .Flipkart please refund my money and i will buy another phone rather than this lenovo a6000 plus 
 Got this mobile month back and i don't see as much problems in it. 
only problem is Camera, its not up to the mark, as it is given 8MP rear cam but it is not wothy for 5MP also. 
Coming to Battery it takes long time to get full battery but it gives 1day back up even after playing Asphault 8 for 1hour. Not heating up as much.. Got a good product from WS Retail. 
Best and great deals in flipkart by WS Retail.. 
I am using Flipkart only with WS Retail products as it is genuinely gives the original product in the before time period it mentioned. 
 after 1 month the touch screen doesn't work. no help from service center too. Al you will through your money in dust bin when buying this product 
 I haven't seen such kind of phone . Lots of features of this mob. are good but , there is a very big problem with its battery ,u can't open multiple apps in this phone . battery backup is not more then one day . AND IF U USE E-NET then battery will be finished in just 3 to 4 hours .and other problem is the battery heats up frequently ,its a manufacturing defect of this phone .
think twice before purchase if u use e-net or u had a job. fine phone for home persons . 
 I had purchased the Product about two weeks back and I have noted that the voice is breaking between calls. If I disconnect the call and call again it might wok correctly. The major issue is that I am not able to predict when it occurs. It might occur after few minutes of a call or after 30 minutes or so. Some times there is no issue at all.  
This is certainly not a range issue as I have faced this problem from different locations while speaking to different people. Also the same network is working fine without break in my old mobile.  
Not sure if this is a device issue or a common problem with this model. Please suggest if any one else have faced the same issue. 
 within few days "Back" button (used to go to previous menu) has stopped functioning.
Has Lenovo lost quality products? 
 Flipkart Delivery was in time just in one day, but the phone received was a faulty one, Keeps Restarting alteast thrice a day, and takes longer amount of time to boot up, i have requested for return, lets see how flipkart team will take further. 
 so you are perches samsung galaxy j5 ......................................................................................................... 
 My Friend had Lenovo A6000, and his phone's Camera was good, so thought to get this phone. However, being A6000 plus, an upgraded version of its predecessor, its picture quality sucks. There are whole lot of grains visible in each picture. I doubt whether this is a 8MP/2MP or a VGA camera. 
We used to see such camera's in phones way before 2005. 
 This phone TOUCH PAD started behaving weirdly , even after giving for service it was worse then before. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE !!!!! 
 body design and specs all worth it,proven to be a best all rounder smartphone in this price range.
camera 7/10
sound 8/10
display 10/10
battery 8/10
user interface 9/10 
people who just make calls and uses small playstore apps will be SATISFIED with my review,but this is not with the case for GAMERS 
if your are game maniac and wanter to install heavy games as soon you get this handset then better think twice before buying. 
this handset heats up from the upper half very badly because of battery discharging very quickly due to high graphics demand by specific games. 
if u install games size more than >80 MB phone will start heating and heat very badly unless you play in AC ROOM.
games like mortal kombat,COD,ASPHALT and mission impossible will make this phone go mad and phone will literally cry. 
so better switch to some high end processors which consist 2nd gen snapdragon or 3rd,dont go for this BECAUSE I AM THE ONE WHO IS SUFFEREING FROM THIS SITUATION 
 This phone is very pathetic, The main problem with this phone is the touch problem. The touch pad make the phone worse. if i try to open message app then it opens chrome app and if i type Hello, some how in msg app then it type some other words like "sdsdd" etc. feel like throwing this phone in dustbin. 
 i was really afraid to buy my mobile from online store because of cheating in delivery..but flipkart is very cheper then other store and 100% reliable to make shopping..Thanks flipkart.
keep shopping with flipkart and lenovo A6000 PLUS is very good mobile having many built in feature and sound is amazing. 
 For 4days i clling the cstmer support to return my phone.there is total touchpad problem with the phone..just 10days old.the customer support is not much responble to return..i cant use this phone for 4days..very bad support 
 am totally satisfied with this phone really working good and speed.... No hanging issue no heating issues ..really good and Good battery backup speed charging ..................................but /airtel Double data offer is not gud airtel team cant give me this.....its bad....
Good Camera Quality Both are
2 Gb ram nice
Good looking
less weight
No any problem is found til now ..........trust Lenovo is really Rock*********** 
 Excellent phone....Worth to buy under 7.5 k.....I write this review after using 2 months....I personally recommend this phone 100%... 
 I have been buying phone for 40 - 50 k but now its just feels like a pure waste of money, This lenovo A6000 Plus is a amazing phone with a very competitive price and has most of the features of a high end phone. 
 I am rating this after 2 week of using it. The battery backup was too good, it long last for more than a day without playing games and with playing games it will last for 14 hrs. I used Asphast 8, Call of duty and other heavy games and it was playing without any lag. 
Touch is also good compared to my previous phone huwaie holly honor. 
Its light weight. Switching between applications without any lag.
The only issue and it lags only when i get any hindi or marathi messages on whatsapp it will hang like it has only 256 mb of memory, i think so this problem should be rectified by the company. 
Company should have provided notification light, navigation key lights and plastic body should be more strong as currently which is not good at all. The mobile has fallen from my hand for more than 5 times but no issues. 
Overall the phone performance, build quality, hardware is best. 
People should go for it and buy. 
 don't buy this phone... 
automatically switches off need to remove battery to power on  
Flipkart just replaces phone no other solution to this issue yet. 
 I bought this phone at least 2 months ago for my wife. From the beginning, the phone is getting switched off very frequently. We have to remove the battery and re attach it to switch on. Seems the battery placement is not proper. This does not seem to a problem with my set only but a common issue per previous comments.  
I would suggest not to buy this phone unless you are okay with your phone getting switched off without your knowledge. 
 I have been using since 3 months..no single issue, excellent phone within budget.Thanks to flipkart for timely delivery 
 I purchased this for my friend. Its a very good phone,
Pros :
Good battery backup
Performance.
Dolby digital Sound.
Nice UI.
Gaming Experience
Cons : 
No Earphoen Included.
Gorilla glass should be there. 
 after every 7-8 hours it automatically switched off and is not ready to boot, I am required to remove battery and refit to restart 
 i like so much.......
no problemes in this mobile,it's speaker is very nice......... 
the reson of buy the mobile is it's very large internal memory & largest ram in satisfied price...  
 1] hotspot is auto on-off problem.
2] Mobile was over heating and battery drains faster. 
3] backup is not more than 2 hours.
4] service centers service is not good.
5] mobile PCB Board is cheap.lots of problem's
 so dn't buy  
 Don't buy this mobile not providing head phone flip kart making fool for pepole they providing head phone Lenovo A6000 but not in A6000plus cheating 
 Very good mobile. Its performance is marvelous. Light weight, handy, high speed processor without hanging problem. This mobile is worthful for your amount. 
The camera quality is amazing. 
 its camera very poor and dont purchase this item its totaly waste of money and flipcart say sorry we cant take return this product 
 First of All i must tell that i don't review products i buy but i have to do this for this. 
I ordered this device on 6th July they sent it to me on 7th July which is kind of surprising because my orders in past reaches me in 3-4 days.
I bought it for my dad. He received the product in his office when he got home i saw the phone and i was amazed wow its was so beautiful i didn't expected this at just 7500rs.FYI i own a nexus 5 which is very nice device and cost about 4 times more than a6000plus but still i can say that lenovo a6000plus is more lighter and thinner than my nexus 5 and it look superb too. 
when i took phone from my dad's hand i turned on display and i was amazed wow!! it was so beautiful and vibrant surely i didnt expected it to be this much good at this price. 
now for phone ui its nice simple pretty much stock expect home which dont have an app drawer it kind of look like MiUi but it not even near that. It dont have customization like miui. But that can be considered an advantage because lots people like stock experience. Just install Google now Launcher it will be like 100% stock. 
Mobile have some preinstalled apps but most of them can be removed which is kind of nice sure it bugs me as am a stock user(nexus 5).but it not like samsung's bloatware. 
for performance i can say that app opening speed is gud but its not smooth or fluid for all time you can feel stutter here and there but still very good performance for price 
Camera- Its Ok but its great if consider price point as you cant get better than that at this range. front cam is nice too. Both cams are good for general pics for instagram and fb. 
Battery- Its give you a day backup which considered great according to today standard. 
Note- For people saying about heating issue i can confirm that there is no heating issue whatsoever. Am sure people who that mobile heats are definitely coming from a non smartphone mobile and they find mobile getting warm an issue. But its normal for smartphones to get warm as you use them.. 
P.S- keep in mind i use a nexus 5 which 3-4 times costlier than this but still i liked this device i can even say that my next device would a lenovo or a xiaomi.. i also have a redmi 1s and a6000plus is better than that in all aspects.  
 I got this phone one day before. It took some time to get the phone from Flipkart. But nicely packed. The headphones are not there. The look is good. Lightweight and comfortable to use. The battery won't last long. But no heating issue untill now and its flexible to use multiple applications at a time, because of the lavishness of 2GB RAM. Overall a good phone. 
 Value for money, Best phone below 10k.
Good camera, Display.
Very good for gaming and watching videos, the phone wont get heated up much even after playing for a long time. Speakers are loud and clear.
Battery life is also good.
Screen guard is provided with the phone.
5 stars for the product. 
 The battery backup was very poor from the first day itself. i thought that it was particularly the problem in my handset so i gave it to service center on the second day . the problem of battery was not cured even after that. after that new problem i interacted with was the heating up of battery by its own. when i charged the battery fully and kept inside my pocket it began to heat up by its own. really fed up of this phone. it is now fourth time in service center , now they are telling that there is problem in the motherboard. the heating problem is in everybody's mobile. i saw more than 20 men with the same problem and same handset. 
 rear camera is very very poor.images from front cam is much much batter then rear cam. i feel that i got 8 mp front cam and 2 mp rear cam :D  
 I've been using this phone since past 5 days, and I've faced no problems at all. Screen is large enough,processor is fast enough, and phone is just perfect.
DON'T LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS THEY JUST GOT A DEFECTED PIECE,
(Don't buy too many of these phones I don't want it be get common lol)
Ratings:-
Camera - 3/5
Processor:- 5/5
Looks:- 5/5
battery life:- 4/5 
nice job lenovo.. completely satisfied! 
 really its cool and awesome phone at present in market. very slim and very light. awesome camera and sound quality:) i like it very much. still now no con has been founded. so dont think any more just click n buy:) 
 Yes i'm using lenovo a6000plus since 1month.. I'll say that it's nice mobile but small problem with that is while charging the mobile, charger dissipates over heat and temple run game gets struck. Rest of that charging is good and good volume and nice touch sensitivity with good camera and all....It's an all time budget mobile.... I'll give 4 out of 5 .... 
 BENCHMARK:->AnTuTu---Score->20512(For A6000 Plus) Versus, 20234(For A6000). Versus,18350(For Moto G Second Generation) 
ADVANTAGES:-----> 
(1) 2 GB of ram(DDR-3) for better multitasking(Which is very good)
(2) 16 GB of internal storage(11.53 GB of usable storage,Which is ample)
(3) A free screen guard is provided by Lenovo (Out of the box)
(4) Active noise cancellation with dedicated mic(Also known as secondary noise cancellation) & Works well in crowded areas.
(5) Dolby Digital Plus Sound(Stereo or Dual Speakers). In fact it is a delight for music lovers. The music can be customized the way (Expand) 
Was this review helpful? Yes No 
 having used all phones from micromax to i phone 6 ,recently purchased this last week slows down i doubt it has 2GB Ram , battary drains 
 this mobile has very good screen clarity, very good sound output via earphones and the vibe UI is very much stable and easy to use i have forgotten google launcher that i used before....... has very good rear camera really impressed with the battery backup with this phone... unfortunately this phone doesn't come with earphones inside the box that is the only con with it but lastly very much impresses with the mobile!!!!!! 
 Please do not buy the mobile . I am facing early discharge of battery and It is heating while speaking on other phone 
 Great mobile for Rs.7000. Light weight, Gud camera, speed is Gud, works fine, only problem is heating.... 
 It heating too much from its back panel and battery also draining too much fast,while i am using it on call it heat around 50'C I feel that i put an heating pad into my pocket rather than Lenovo 6000 Plus.Another issue issue is Battery Drain.It shutdown into half an hour however it was 100% Charged.  
So please beware of it and replacement policy also will make you sick to service and they don't have any solution. 
 Received the phone within 4 days of ordering , awesome delivery by Ws Retail.
Loaded features in Very Low Budget. 
1)First of all 2GB RAM makes the phone very faster, no lagging issues .. Till time no heating issues faced..16GB of inbuilt ROM, fr this no external memory required.  
2)5 inch 1280*720 HD Dispaly makes ur video or movie smarter. it can also play .mkv files, 1080p videos, DTS enabled movies, BR(Downloaded from torrent) movies also without any frame drop or lagging !!!  
3)Awesome loud dual speakers.. highly loud.. properly audible ringtones in high chaos.
## only problem is that the speakers are in backside, if u put ur mobile on bed or table, the sound will be suppressed. 
4) very lite Thin phone.. seems like u r holding a small remote. 
5)Inbulit game asphalt 8,spider man 
6)brilliant phone for music lovers, lots of features for music section.(i.e DOLBY)

**Only I found a drawback, there is no notification light option. if u get any msg or miss call , u will not be notified by any light . no notification light option is there .  
IN A WORD, BRILLIANT PHONE IN THIS BUDGET, NO HEATING ISSUES . 
 I received this phone on 5th June and till now no any problem faced. 
Battery life is good no any heating problem while online.
Able to watch HD video
sound quality is best (Dolby system)
Gaming performance also good
Packing and delivery by flipkart I want to give them 5 stars
Branding both the side (Front and Back) 
Notification Light is missing..... 
Go for it........ 
 first of all the service of flipkart was very very fast. i got the product on the next day. now apart from that phone is just awesome. it is a good budget phone having many features. just go for it!!! 
 Bought this on 9th June. Got it three days later. Flipkart delivered it on time. Packaging was very nice. 9 out of 10 for Flipkart. 
Pros:
Phone is good. 
Looks is very good. 
UI on phone is good. 
High end games like N.O.V.A. 3,Asphalt 8, MC5, Real Racing 3 runs nicely.(sometimes fps drops) .
2 Gb of RAM and 1.2 GHz processer is good for multitasking.
Price is only 7K Plus & you get 4G. 
Cons:
Camera. (outdoor capturing nice but indoor is not so good)
Battery quickly dry out.(average use)
Heating problem.(just listening music and it's heat up) 
Happy to buy this phone. It's a pretty decent phone.
If you want to buy this go for it . You will not disappoint. 
 I have bought lenova6000+ on sale at june 2nd ,i use "in a day delivery" excellent shipping from the flipkart they deliver with gift wrap on the next day itself ,im planning it for my anniversary,so i really thank you for the good service keep it up..... 
 the phone is good and its working condition is also good. only slight heating when using internet / other, the most important is when is purchased i did not receive headset with phone, please check all. 
 Some users were reviewing that this set has heating problem but I haven't encountered any thing till now. 
Besides that 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM, 8MP front cam, 2MP rear cam, Qualcomm processor, These are all in 7499/- . That is really like a fairyland. Soft keytouch and very sensitive.  
One drawback; RAM is always occupied between 700mb and 800mb.  
 This model having 2GB Ram and 16 GB inbuilt everything ok but Speaker condition particularly loud speaker very worst.Who ever liking to hear songs in loud speaker please don't buy this model.Its totally not good effort.Video recording also clarity good but sound effort worst.Camera also rear 8GB but its working like 4GB effort only.
Other than this mobile all are good.(Like browsing,Mobile speed,etc..) 
 I recently got this Mobile.Design....Display is really good.It comes with 2 GB Ram and i can play almost all the game without any lag.8 MP rear Camera is quite good.What makes it more special is 4G .I had almost searched all website and no phone comes with all this features-2GB RAM,1.2 PROCESSOR,16GB ROM,8MP CAMERA,4G at that price.
Really worth to buy a budget phone. 
 Has Heating issue and it is like you can iron your clothes.
No need to connect the charger it gets heated on his own will. I will not be surprised if it will burst any time. 
 Delivery : 
Got my Lenovo in 2 days. Product was packed neatly and safely. 
*10/10* For fast Delivery 
First Look: 
Got my hands on the Lenovo A6000 plus which fits my hands perfectly. Got a screen guard free with it. Head Set is not included with this mobile which is a con. Overall look is fantastic
*9/10*  
Accessory:
Got a 1 amp Usb wall charger. It is a good quality charger which can get the phone fully c harged from 0% battery in about 3.30 hours. Screen guard was included.
*10/10* For a good charger 
Features
2 Gb Ram is required for a smartphone to run smoothly. Powered by the snapdragon 64 bit cpu the phone is quite good at this price range but the phone still lacks a Lollipop update wich can run on 64 bit os but currently is runs on 4.4.4 Android Kitkat which is 32bit. Lenovo will release a update soon. 
*10/10* 
Built Quality
Phone is slim and sleek and quite light. It has a flex plastic back cover which is quite strong and sturdy. Display is colorful and bright.
*10/10* For awesome built quality 
Battery Back up 
Phone's battery last for a very long time. It can run a whole day if you use it for internet browsing and gaming. 
10/10 
Gaming
Gaming experiance is awesome in this phone. Can easily handle all the high end games like Asphalt 8,Fifa 15,Dead Trigger 2 , 6 guns Smoothly without any frame rate drops.
But phone heats up during continuous gaming. 
9/10  
 I Got this phone next day from order, im impressed by flipkart
But disappointed from Lenovo, this is the 1st phone of my life which didn't come with handsfree.
i should've read package content before ordering the product, thats why im giving 4 star
EDIT 1 :- Facing heating issue in this phone
EDIT 2 :- After 2 days using this phone, i must say that this phone have major heating problem, i used it 15 minutes regular use and its like im holding a heater in my hand
Anyone facing the same problem like me?
i wont recommend anyone to buy his phone
please dont buy this phone 
 I RECEIVED THIS Lenovo A6000 Plus ON 25/05/2015. ITS SPEED IS AMAZING BUT HEATS UP VERY FAST. 
I LIKE IT IN VIEW OF ITS PERFORMANCE.  
JEET BHUMBLA 
 Hanging problem in the phone. This phone hangs suddenly while using and you will get a black screen. Pressing the power button or the volume rocker does not do anything. I got an exchange for the issue but the new phone also has the same problem. I think this is a problem with the phone only.  
Camera is also not up to the mark however using Google Camera app gives better picture. 
Battery backup is good.Vibe UI is also nice. 
Lenovo and Flipkart please correct the hanging problem... 
 Hello everyone, This is my first review so you can trust on my review. 
I have ordered Lenovo A6000 Plus before reading reviews. but after reading review I was lil bit worried. So my review based on 15 days of usage 
* Delivery was good, as I received my mobile within 3 days. Thanks flipkart for fast delivery
* Looks well
* Slim
* Awaysome UI
* Design is good
* Happy with HDR camera
* Didnt find any heating problem for normal usage
* Battry charging time is more than noraml phones. 
I am very much happy with this phone. 
 During buying this phone i was thinking too much as lenova is not a known brand in Smart phones.However I need a Phone below 8k having good specs ,this was looks promising so i bought.once it came to my hand and I can say i have taken very correct decision.
Below are the pros and cons. 
Pros:With this money this is the only phone having Very Good specs So worth for money.
 Phone build is very good 
 light waited
 battery backup 
Cons:
 No gorilla Glass
 UI can be more attractive   
 Awesome display, more than satisfactory camera, good processor and a smart looking handset. There may be a few shortcomings but you don't get much to complain in 7499. Screen guard in box given wasn't of good quality. Rest everything is more than satisfactory for me after 6 days of usage. No heating issue(nothing at all). Very good to formidable battery backup depending on usage. 
 its performence is good and smooth but i am facing a problem of battery porblem and heat issue with phone and also requested three times for retun they are rejecting my request but i didnt expected from flipkart. 
 It is getting hanged even for a simple game. Charge is lasting for less than a day. Very very slow device as compared to other mobiles with quad core. 
2GB RAM and 16 GB are attractive. But they are not useful......! Totally disappointed. 
 Lenovo a6000plus is very heat & no battery backup 2-3 hours in battery backup, 
battery charging is 12 hours in full charg 
 it is a good phone as it is light in weight , 2 gb ram and thin sleek design . i am giving it four star for white charger with black phone and without headphone. 
 This review is based on after month usage. Overall good phone in this price. No lags, awesome performance, this mobile does not have any notification problem. I get notifications even if the app is not running in the background. 
Just one battery backup after immense use. 
 Sound Quality not at all good. its like old china handset with multiple speakers with vibrations and disturbance. 
 I bought this phone for my mom last week from Flipkart. The delivery was so good. About the phone: It's really a budget phone packed with a lot of feautres. It's selfie (2MP) cam is good for taking amazing selfies. The back cam is not that good. It does provide you a 16GB internal storage. 2GB RAM and Quad core processor makes it work smooth. Light weight phone. Good battery backup. A worth buy under 10k. Go for it guys! 
 Value for money and good to go with this. Every product has its own +&-. We should not expect more in this price. 
 I have been using this for 3 days now. Was very skeptical about it because of mixed reviews, but till now I see no major issues.
Lot of reviews mention heating issues, I didn't experience that. I played Asphalt 8 for an hour, which is just enough to heat up a phone with any processor related heating issues. And by the way the gameplay was pretty smooth at default(medium) graphics setting :)
Having said that it did heat up while charging, but that is not really an issue.  
Pros:  
1. Very sleek design, super light weight. I don't even realize there's a phone in my pocket. 
2. Excellent configuration at this price. 2 GB RAM, Snapdragon quadcore 1.2 GHz, 16 GB ROM and one feature which was pretty important to me, expandable memory slot. 
3. Great display quality, it's a delight to watch HD videos on this one. 
4. 2300 mAh battery does quite well, I suggest you get a 2A charger as it does take 2.5-3 hrs to charge from 0-100 . It lasts a whole day with moderate-heavy usage. 
5. Though i didn't shoot a lot, the main camera seems pretty good. Just that indoor/low light shots have visible pixels in them.  
Cons: 
1. It runs kit-kat with Vibe UI on top. I really do not like the Vibe UI. It is not so smooth, lacks aesthetic appeal. I'm waiting for either a lollipop update or a stable Cynogen ROM. 
2. Front camera is not good, but hey, I'm no selfie freak, so works out for me ;) 
3. It does get heated up while charging.  
4. No cornering gorilla glass(buy a good tempered glass screenguard).  
Overall, I'd say It is definitely a steal at this price given that there's no deal breaker cons. 
Go for it! 
 Not a very great phone, but value for money. The UI is not great, it has heating and hanging problems 
 I am using this device for about two weeks now and I am going to give some pros and cons of this device.
PROS:
1.Firstly I must say that the internal storage of this device is sufficient for even a power user.you get about 11.53 gigs for installing apps.Also the 2gb ram handles multitasking easily.
2.Secondly,this device does not heat up too much.For eg I played MC5,Asphalt 8 etc on this device but it did not heat up that much.
3.Thirdly,this is a very compact phone,as it would easily fit into your pocket.Good for rough use.
4.The battery life is also decent and if you are a heavy user then it would easily last for 1.5 days or so. 
Now some Cons
1.Firstly it does not have any gorrila glass protection.
2.Also in terms of looks,it is not a great device.
3.The front camera quality is not that good. 
(But overall I must say that its a good device and you can go for it if looks of a device does not matter to you) 
 bahut jyada hining hota he our hang bhi bettry charging very silo bad prformes our touch bhi itna kas nahi he 
 A very nice phone at this cost.
Mobile clarity is so good.
Front camera, very nice for to take selfie's also having good clarity at photos.
No hanging and heating problem.
Come to battery, 2300 mah, is ok for this phone.
Professional look.
Touch so good.
Weightless phone. 
Thanks for the Lenova, for providing this phone at lower cost with good clarity & RAM speed.
Friends i suggest u to buy this phone. 
 Got delivery of the A6000+ on 21st May 2015 and as per 1 Day promise from Flipkart. 
Readers this is one hell of a phone, and for 7499/- this is a steal -- there is no other phone in the Indian market to beat this price and specs. 
Lets speak about some basic features that everyone around would usually use : 
1. Processor -- 64Bit Snapdragon 410 @ 1.2 GHz, don't look at the Ghz, there are faster speeds in the market but this is a Snapdragon 64 bit so the processing power is just enough to take you around in pride. I am able to play heavy high-end games flawlessly on this phone including Asaphalt 8 Airbourne, Real Racing 3, NOVA, NFS, etc and that too at FULL settings. The games don't lag even a bit  
Complimented with 2GB RAM Apps load super fast including the games, and with multiple apps running in the background the phone still has sufficient RAM to load more. 
2. Camera : 8MP BSI with a very powerful Flash, both from front and back cameras so a good job especially in low lit areas. Night photography or darkly lit places are usually a nightmare for most cameras however not with Lenovo A6000+. 
For today's life where one visits a pub or lounge and the place is not lit so well and we want to click some photos of friends !! Then the flash is powerful enough to light up the entire place and click superb photos. 
The flash also doubles into a very powerful Flash Light. 
3. HD screen @ 720p but flawlessly plays 1080p videos also, there is no Gorilla Glass or Dragontail or any other protection on it however one can easily but a tempered glass screen in after-market stores also on Flipkart (just in case you are careless with your phones) 
4. Battery -- This is the biggest enemy of all Android phone users, most low cost phones have 2000 mAh batteries that don't last more than 5-6 hours and one needs to be at charging point for most of the time. 
However, Lenovo has paid special attention to this factor and packed in a powerful 2300 mAh Polymer (removeable battery) battery which easily lasts 21-24 hours with moderate to heavy usage. 
My usage is 30-40 mins Games, 1 hour approx of calling, 3G always ON, Whatsapp is always ON and chatting on it through out the day, 2 hours of Music over Bluetooth, 4-5 hours browsing entire day. 
5. Speaker and Sound: Dolby Sound system and Dual Speaker give RICH and Crisp sound output especially while playing games or watching some video 
Please don't read reviews of users that say that this phone sucks or is horrible and all that. 
I am an end user and I have not come across any issues at all with this phone. 
Yet somethings I must state that maybe cons for most: 
1. Only 1 Sim Slot has 3G/4G support so if you are a dual simmer like me and need to switch 3G / 4G connectivity between two service providers then one has to open the back panel of the phone and switch SIMs manually 
2. The screen could have been shipped with a hardened material like Gorilla Glass or Asahi Dragontail -- however like I mentioned above there are after market solutions also available. 
3. The speaker output is not Loud yet the sound is crisp, that is because Dolby does not work in LOUD sounds, so if you want the speaker to sound louder then switch off Dolby 
And again at Rs.7499/- you go wrong with this phone 
 very good camera both front and back, good HD display, lightweight, excellent storage...
@ this price lenovo has done a fine job. only problem is the lack of headphones but that does not hide other features. OVERALL BETTER THAN REDMI2 & MOTOE2. 
 Whorth for money, Nice Picture Quality, Battery Back Up Ok, 2gb Ram it helps too run better, over all Nice to use, But Headphone is missing in Box 
 This phone was presented by a gift for my birthday by my brother, I used this phone a lot. 
It is very Impressive, Still did not face any issue,especially heating, but most of the review says there is heating issue, but i did not face the heating issue, 
The design was really nice and the performance is extraordinary. I recommend you to go for it. 
Talking about the camera, My brother has Micromax Canvas Nitro it has 13 mp rear camera, we just compare the both camera performance Lenovo is prity good in low light but not in day time. It impressive in night and low light condition. video recording are also decent. 
I did not face any network issue, It is very smooth on browsing and chatting. 
The battery performance is good but not the best, but it is ok for moderate usage,it comfortable for one day. Played game for 15 miniues battery drop by 4 percentage. 
Almost you have more than 11 gb for User memory out of 16 gb. 
When talking about the Sound quality, Dolby is very impressive. I used my pc head phone (Zebronics head phone) for music, its really mind blowing, The surrounding sound is a master piece.The only disappointment is it does not comes with ear phone. And there is no solid Display Protection like Gorilla Glass 3 or Dragon Trail Glass. On 7500 it is a best Budjet device. 
The GPRS is fine : It shows my accurate location. 
I faced a slight lag when i am playing a game, but it is not irritative.(just a slight frame drop) I think it will fixed automatically after updating device. 
Overall Satisfied with this device. 
 I live at Howrah, West Bengal, ordered this product on 12th, got it by 14th may. Thanks flipkart..
It just 1 week is going, I am happy with my new phone. It is awesome, Camera quality is not so much high but it is good no doubt. Front facing camera is also good for good quality selfie. 2 gb ram is also good, I have always free 1.2 gb of 2 gb ram. Taking in hand my all friends said that this handset is fast enough. Dolby sound is awesome. Have a Smooth touch of 5 finger. Still now I have no issue. I dont know why other reviews are given here like heat engine etc etc...No, there is nothing heating issue. Battery is going for 1 day with keeping wifi online throughout the whole day.  
Now just I have installed AnTuTu Benchmark. After testing, score is 21072. Nice, it ranks just after the Zenphone 5. Below my handset, there are so many high range phones like Moto G, Xperia, etc etc... Those who know about benchmark score 21000, may understand what I want to say. 
I can recommend to to go for this phone. It is really a nice product. But dont blame me if, particularly your handset is not like me. Yes, obviously Being an Electronic good, the quality is just a luck for you. But I think am lucky... 
 what is bad:
slow charging battery, but drains out fast!!!!!!!!!
not good for playing candy crush(i can observe that the jelly's move slow compare to motog2)
so often there is a heating problem(inspite of chat in whatsapp for 10 mins).
Rear camera(8MP) is not so good. 
what is good: front camera, light in weight. 
i requested flipkart for refund, but they are accepting by blaming lenovo that lenovo cellphones are like this only.... am still waiting for refund, flipkart is cheating me by not giving me the refund. 
 having issue with notifications of wats app and facebook etc.plzzz give any feedback
others things are all ok.. cam is little bit hazy 
 After 1 month of usage I realize that it is worth to buy this mobile.
When compared with redmi 2 it is lighter and there is no heating issue, whereas
there is some heating issue in redmi 2. In same range there is one more option Moto-E 2nd generation but I think Lenovo A6000 plus deserves the best. 
 DESIGN ,FUTURES EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT LOWEST PRICE AND QUICK DELIVERY GOOD BACKUP BATTERY BOTH CAMERA VERY GOOD 
 I am buy 3lenovo a6000 plusitss very good phone for this price and the quality on this phone is better than .lava.Micromax. Intex.Sony.sumsung.lg.geonie.phones in 10000 rs sounds quality its awseme camera is very good in night I like this phone but company not give a better earphone pls give it a better earphone pls 
 Im posting this after 1 week of usage. I have used Lenovo A6000 which i got for my mom before 4 months. its runs grealty.
 I Bought Lenovo A6000+ on May 5 Flash sale, got delivered within 48hrs. 
After 1 Week of usage :
Pros:
1.Battery comes for 1d 16 hrs on avg usage and 1d 2h on heavy usage.
2.Amazing Display.
3.1.35GB ram Spaces .
4.16gb ROM is enough.
5.Camera both are decent. (Remember ur getting phone for 7.5k and not 75k, so the cam quality differs) Decent in this range.
6. NO lags till now.
7.Sexy n slim, light weight, handy, when i keep in my pocket i dont feel a phone inside my pocket & Good Design.
8.No heating issues i faced on calls till 45-50mins. 
Cons: 
1. Heats after 1hr of game play usually happens.
2.No earphones.
3.Slow charging Takes upto 4 hrs from 2%-100%.
4.Back cover very light. Handle with Care while opening and closing. 
Finally : A MUST BUY PHONE FOR 8K RANGE. 
U can blindly buy this Product. 
 presently using it as secondary phone. Dont buy it if you have used samsung or sony previously. It has a pathetic touch response. Literally i have to press the surface to use this phone unlike sony/samsung. I have no complaints about the performance of this device. Regarding the software part, it has a quite a number of bugs. The settings get reverted to stock settings every now and then. If u r in a call and If someone calls in between, the number is not displayed. These are few major bugs. Overall I would rather go for better brand. 
 After reviwing so many phones and using YU, I have taken this mobile, pretty good. 
Very fast
NO problems with apps
No heating
Excellent 
 Nice phone with ample specs and priced fiercely against competition.
No lags super, but battery last for a day only. 
 All the specifications are very good and the mobile is awesome in every aspect.But i am unable to recieve whats app notifications.... 
 Review after 2 Weeks use working fine no issues only little heat while playing high definition games. great phone with this price 
 Simply great phone within 7.5k Price bracket. Good selfie camera. fast- thanks to 2GB RAM and 12 GB ROM. Slim and sexy look. Good display and dolby digital sound. 
Now the problem is No Magnetic sensor support, therefore cant use compass apps on this phone, Battery life is not good enough. No LED Notification light, No Back light on rear bottom. Back camera is not 8MP. One sim slot is dedicated for 3G/4G, BUT another is 2G only. No head phone provided, Its ok as lenovo headphones are not good enough. 
Compare to pros and cons i would like to recommend for short time user, who want to use this for a year or year n half. NOT for long term user. 
 I don't know why some bad reviews here. I purchased this mobile ,till now I didn't get any problem which is mentioned in bad reviews.
Graphics nice, no hanging, battery is also fine,
Even when you take photos it come above 1 mb flash work fine in dark, so in this price what is bad?
I think it is perfect to buy lenovo A60000 plus in this range. 
 every thing is good :) :)
sound quality is amazing
selfie camera is quit less than zenfone 5 
bas yek headset v de diya hota 
 The mobile has very good specs and price is also attractive only thing is the availability of the colour is only grey if more colours this product become very attractive one 
 Thank you flipkart for delivering the product with no damages and also before the delivery date.. 
1. Handy phone with light weight.
2. Dolby sound worth for it.
3. Cameras are worth for this price 
Cons:
1. No earphones.
2. USB cable is too short  
 I Have Purchased this mobile for my brother...  
1. No Head phone on box 
2. Good front Camera
3. Less wait.
4. Nice sound quality 
Overall 4/5 
 Not as good as it sounds. Build quality is very poor. The screen color reproduction is bad. Touch sensitivity is also bad. No gorilla glass. Camera ok. Battery backup not more than a day. Hangs sometimes and the os also lags a bit. No OTG support, compass. Also no option to return. Better go with moto e 2nd gen 4g. Except camera beast and best in class 
 I am using this mobile regular for two days and i say that this mobile is Baap of all android mobiles in this price range.I played many games such as SubwaySurfer,Minion Rush or Asphalt 8 without Lagging.This is the Best phone as i ever used.No heating Issues.
But there are some cons(not cons does not have some features)--  
1.Does not have any notification light for charging or messaging
2.No earphone 
3.No Gorilla glas 
But in this price i say best phone,I did not understand why customer gives bad reviews.I think that they want Iphone 6s feature in this price range as say Jitna milta hain utna kam hain 
 Strong Recommend for Buy, Very Good Phone With Nice Music Output Dolby, HD Display, 2 GB RAM, 5 Inch Display, Etc. The Battery life very good as compare Asus Zenphone5, Lava Iris X8 & Other 2gb RAM phone. Thanks Lenovo & Flipkart Team. Keep give such a nive products in future also. 
 One word is enough.
Go for it.
Fantastic Display
Superb sound, Picture quality
Excellent speed
Wonderful touch  
 I was a samsung smart phone fan until I bought this mobile on the 28th Sale. I must admit I'm Truly Madly Deeply in love with this piece. Everything is right as it must be. Thanks Lenovo. 
 It working is good..best packing precautions on delivery ....excellent mobile smooth touch wiyh 2 gb ram 16gb internal memory...finally simply gooood. 
 Excellent gadget worth the money invested. Best in class of 2G RAM, Excellent picture quality. weather touch & light weight 
 A very nice phone, probably the best in money to satisfaction ratio...I have used Asus Zenfone 5...trust me that is the only comparable phone under 10 k...forget moto g or moto e.1 or 2 dosn't really matter..they are things of past....Zenfone has awesome UI and very useful inbuilt apps..It's camera is top notch...on the other hand...battery sucks,,,screen not that great,,,and heats when you charge,play game and on call...not that much but stilll...this phone..UI not the best...but very good...battery excellent...2gb ram...16gb internal space..runs very smoothly without any issues at all...only reason not a 5 star is screen does not have gorilla glass and some tweeks are req in ui... 
 Oh, when this beautiful piece of engineering came under my hood, I was insanely excited. I had been viewing this smartphone for past few days on and when an upgrade "plus" came , I drooled over it. The specs 2GB RAM and humongous 16GB is the best combination offered by the company at 7500.  
I am loving it and it's design. I cannot take my hands off her. Love it.  
 Genuine review after use of 9 Months.  
Ordered it on 28th April 2015 & Received it on 2nd May 2015 from Flipkart.  
Good things about the phone :  
1) 5 inch display with 1280*720 (HD) pixels 
2) Quallcomm Snapdragon 2 GB RAM 
3) 16 GB Internal Space 
4) Better Front Camera even it is only 2 Megapixel 
5) Light Weight phone - 128 gm only. 
6) Dolby Digital speakers 
7) Good battery backup. Max - 15 Hours Min - 12 Hours with continues use of internet.  
Bad things about the phone & accessories :  
1) Earphones are not available with phone. Only screen guard and Charger provided. 
2) OTG not supported. ( which can be ignored looking at the price of phone.) 
3) Cheap quality of back cover. ( which can be ignored looking at the price of phone.)  
I will recommend people to buy this phone as it is better phone in average budget.
Lenovo should provide earphones at least. 
Well done !! Lenovo !!! 
 Beautiful phone with great build quality!! worth every money spent! Very light in hand and no lags, no hanging so far. An excellent phone, capable of handling all your communication needs with good enough camera. I would highly recommend this phone to any one who is getting into smartphone world without any doubt. Flipkart makes the entire purchase experience a cakewalk! 
 This mobile was delivered to me very vastly. Thanks to flipkart.
In this budget this is good smart phone with awesome features.... 
----Look and feel is very good.
----light weight..
----Display is good.
----Front camera is very good.Back camera is good.
----Pixel resolution is good.
----Processor speed is good.
----Supporting large games because of 2GB RAM.
----Sound quality is good. 
Cons:----
----Back door is very delicate,not strong one.
----Not a Corning Gorilla glass.
----Little bit heating issue.
----Head phones not provided.  
 best phone ever in these price group.Only one Issue no light in all three Navigation Keys so a bit problem in night to operate phone but not a major problem. 
 At first thanks to flipkart for this quick delivery..delivered before expected date..
Phone is great at this price.. All features are good..Drawback only the camera..not upto the mark..Also no head phone inside the box pack.. 
 This mobile is worth getting for this price with 2 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM. Light weight, so that u won't feel that you are carrying a mobile with you. Mainly the preloaded apps with Lenovo security apps are worth using for safety of your mobile. 
 GOOD PRODUCT AWAITING SINCE JAN 2015. BUT LENOVO A6000 PLUS COME WITH 2GB RAM AND 16 GB INTERNAL ROM . LOVELY SPEED IN WI FI AND BLUETOOTH. RECOMMENDING ALL BUYERS TO GET 4G CONNECTIVITY IN 5-10K BUDGET WITH BEST BRAND OF LENOVO KNOWN FOR STRONG DESIGN IN FEATURE. 
 Excellent Product and features at very reasonable prices..only drawback no headphone included...even screen guard is included in the box...if u r planning to buy this phone dont wait...buy it with flip cover bcoz cover not available in the market as it is new launch 
 very good phone but why?
Battery backup good around 12 hrs ( watching 3 movies with full brightness and net surfing around 3 hrs , 2 hrs video playing, charge becomes 100 to 3% )
Good camera : lenovo used Sony CMOS sensor
rear cam in daylight and low light it is superb but in very low light not good
Colour production vary up to 10 %
Front camera is good
Fast Ram :
2gb DDR3 533MHz , available ram is around 1.35 GB that's very good 
Processor: Antutu benchmark score is 20089
no lag when playing medium range game and when watching full HD videos even playing inbuilt video player
Very fast openning apps
Very low heat produced when download via 3g
Disadv:1. loose fitting back cover
2. No lollipop
3. No earphones
Conclusion: Who thought buying a Samsung phone under rs 14000 i think that is very dangerous decision because low speed processor , ram frequency is low always hang , very poor battery backup only only camera quality is little better than that ad compared to 8 mp Samsung camera. My Samsung frd Amit also upset when he saw my phone it is much better than smasung 7562 in all terms as even taking camera quality.
If u not like this product u are looking for others product like micromax yureka , xiaomi redmi 2 huawei honor 4x
But are budged is low and your main agenda is camera up can wait for huawei honor play 4c and it will be launched in mid may,2015 ( around rs 7999) 
 Awesome phone in this price. Better than others: 
Sound Quality is awesome.
Screen quality is very nice - rich bright color
weight is just 128gm.
NO Heating Problem 
Overall a good buy at this price point... 
 i am writting this review after 2 days of use 
pros.
touch is very sensitive
display is vibrant and viewing angle is awesome.
VibeUI 2.0 is very smooth. you will definitely love it.
rear camera is ok. front camera is good for skype calling.
after 3 hours of use battery reduced by only 19% (45%-26).
i can play loud music approximately with no distortion.
the build quality is decent and u will have a good feel while holding the handset in hand.
snapdragon 410 is performing up to its mark. no lag.
2 gb ram and 16 gb internal memory guys. ''BAAP OF PERFORMANCE''
cons.
no back lit button, may be a problem in dark night.
honestly speaking, didn't find any remarkable one. 
you cannot expect very impressive and high performance from such a low budget VFM handset.
Overall its a nice one. go for it. 
 hi guys i m very very happy to buy this product, this is excellent product in our budget, first time in my life bought such a nice mobile.Every thing is nice just buy it hurry ,,,,, 
 Best Phone, No Lags and Very Smooth interface. Speacially battery backup is also good. Camera Rear n Front are Good. No issues after 1 week of usage. 
 positive: 
2 gb ram is perfect,
battery performance is good,
stand by time is excellent, 
cam 8mp is good but night snap little noise but its okay,
front 2mp is superb,
call quality is superb,
gaming performance also super with dolby, 
negative: 
no head phone ,
taking little extra time for charging (a6000 taken long time to charge but a6000+ is got improve), 
totally the phone is rocking , at the time we cant forgotten the seller (ws retail is the best seller in my online shopping history , already i have buy more item in ws retail only ) 
 simply super price tag
good battery back up
nice display 
good touch
sound quality excellent
antutu score 21k both a6000 also
overalllllllllllllllll nice buy it 
 Phone is perfect for gamers and heavy app users, it is feather light (you don't believe it just hold it and it would be the first statement) , the feel is great especially the back cover good grip. The phone has got a very good display and nice pre-loaded apps. 
The Camera should have been on a higher side is the only con else it is a must buy phone if you are looking for one which has features of a 15 K+ Phone with a price less than 10K :) 
 horror moves hot scene videoduj Lenovo A6000 Plus' cameras deliver mixed results. Photos snapped in daylight are impressive, whether it's a close-up or long shot. It struggles in low-light, and the HDR mode and flash aren't recommended either. For more details on the camera and performance, stay tuned for our full review of the A6000 Plus. Until then, you can check out our unboxing and first impressions very good. 
 It's awesome.. 
Pros:
Affordable price ( with all the specs required by a common user )
sleek design & Light weight ( single hand operation )
Long battery life & looking bright @ 0 brightness ( even though 2300 mah )
RAM 2 GB is adding great value to the phone
Vibe ui
rear /front camera picture quality
 Dolby Speakers are treat to ear 
Cons:
** The phone comes without headphone**
No Notification Light ( its mandatory Now a days )
Gorilla Screen ( so that we can use it roughly )
No head set ( even though Lenovo headsets r useless :P )
Build quality looks poor & sensitive if u observe with out back panel
OTG not supported 
 First for Flipkart: 
Order phone on 29th April 2015, 4:11PM and got the phone delivered on "30th April 2015, 9:40AM". They have delivered the phone in 17 hours :-) Guys at Flipkart Rock! 5 ***** to them. 
Now coming to the phone features.
Pros:
1. Decent Budget phone at 7.5k
2. Speaker quality is good
3. Lenova UI is also good to go with.
4. No lag at all, thanks to 2GB ram.
5. Better Battery Backup. You could easily get up to 30 hours of moderate to high usage. 
Cons:
1. Camera quality both rear and front could have been better.
2. No head phones. I understand this is a cost cutting factor but was expecting their older version had head phones. 
Will have to use and see how it performs over the period. But overall with first three days of usage, I am happy with the phone. 
 After using the mobile for 10-15 minutes only, mobile is getting very hot. Which is the crucial problem with this. You cant take in your hand nor you can keep in your pocket. 
 The product I was looking for! 
Best in class according to the price. Awesome features and crystal clear HD display with no hangups of the OS. 
Especially, its very light weight! Its a Gift for my wife and she loved it! 
Recommended if you dont want to spend much and get the best in the market. 
 Awesome performance by the phone after upgrading the RAM to 2 GB. Storage space is also sufficient. Rest is same as its predecessor A6000. Thanx to flipkart for providing the product at such decent rate. 
 i use this mobile about 1 day full it's awesome .............
i like so much..............
it;'s really great......  
 Just as the name suggests, "PLUS", it definitely is an upgrade from the A6000.
First impressions - super cool phone with great design, feels good in hand, crisp and a vibrant display, the much needed 2GB of RAM and 16GB Internal Space is just awesome, and the camera quality is really good... 
The not so good things - No OTG Support, No Andoird Lollipop (the phone will eventually get one but for now have to settle with the Kitkat Version), No headphones included in the box. 
None the less, a superb phone by Lenovo. Kudos to them and Flipkart (for the quick delivery :) )
For a price of 7.5k, this is the best in the market... Go grab one in the next Flash Sale.. 
 Lenovo A600 plus is a fine product for the amount of 7499 rupees. And delivery from flipkart is also good. They delivered me the product within two days. 
 no lag .fast superb camera in daylight.but in night not too clear.no heating problem .really loved it 
 Hi Guys!!! 
Wonderful performance, Camera quality is too good , Touch response is smooth, sound quality is awesome, Slim phone with no hanging and no heating issue.

2) good Camera quality 
3) Very fast for games and multitasking 
4)sleek design and light weight 
5)Detects laptop for transferring files in MTP mode ( Media transfer) in microusb/charging port
6) Hopefully get the Lollipop upgrade soon. 
 VERY LIGHT WEIGHT PHONE WITH A GOOD SCREEN AND BATTERY BACK UP. PHONE WAS DELIVERED TO ME IN 1 WORKING DAY FOR A NOMINAL FEE. NO COMPLAINTS WHATSOEVER. 
 Was little hesitant to try out a new phone brand such as lenovo. But eventually came along after I bought Lenovo A7000. This is quite good and suits your needs.
Pros :
2GB RAM, 16GB Internal Storage, Twin Dolby Speakers (quite attractive), fast processor.
Cons :
No earphones !! are you kidding me ! Primary camera is not as good as secondary, comes with Kitkat instead of Lollipop, no default themes which is pretty bad. 
Overall, it is a good phone for the best price. Thanks to Flipkart team for making the delivery in time. 
 1 : great fast delivery less then 22 hours 
2 : mobile speed is very fast with 2 GB ram & 1.2 GHZ Quad core CPU
3 : battery back up is very nice after full charge with 3G internet use, play games still 34 % remain 
4 : display is very bright & sharply clear
5 : both camera is great
some user write no headphone, no back light in touch button in this price you will get so much so don't worry buy this phone   
 I have received the product in good condition. 2GB RAM and 16GB internal memory in this budget is good. Tried accessing as of now no lagging observed. Good to have a smartphone with good configuration in the budget of 7499/-. If they have given headset it would have been added plus point to the initial registered buyers. 
 I booked a Lenova A6000 Plus by paying Rs.7499/- and it was delivered within two days, but the product performance is not good as the Incoming Calls voice is not audible and as per the advice I have downloaded App to check and your product specialist called on 20th Jan, but not able to get problem solved.
Now I received SMS informing that "We regret to inform that seller has disapproved your return request for Lenovo ....in the Order OD 304930328193482000. Please check you email for more details or click here:...............bla blab
and expressed sincere apologies for inconvenience caused. Feel free to reach out to us for further clarification. 
What is the fun of reaching your customer care for further clarification. I strongly believe with this experience that We should not place orders for any product from Flipkart and request the flipkart not to market Lenovo products which ultimately get bad name to Flipkart.  
 I am very unhappy with Flipkart for delaying my Refund despite several emails & calls !
in your FAQ, you have mentioned that for orders cancelled before shipment, refund will be given immedietly !!
BUT IT 15 DAYS & STILL AMOUNT HAS NOT BEEN CREDITED TO MY ACCOUNT !
HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ORDER ANYTHING THRU FLIPKART HENCE FORTH,& THE SAME MATTER WILL BE POSTED IN MY WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK ,TWITTER SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW HOW UNPROFESSIONAL FLIPKART IS !!!!!!   
 I have recently purchase this phone, after using a month its HOME key stopped working. 
Look for other reliable brands before finalizing your order. 
 Bought this device on 19th Oct 2015 and within 5 days of usage, started experiencing ghost touches. Sometimes it scroll pages on its own, sometimes random selections happen, sometimes the screen doesn't even respond at all.
I installed the multi-touch app and found out the screen is reading touch inputs even when I'm not touching at all.
I looked up the problem online and to my surprise, almost everyone is experiencing this. Even the replacement unit Flipkart gives out faces the same issue.
So if you are going to buy this device, do reconsider and look for alternatives. 
 i buy this phone MAy-2015 and face issue OVERHEATING AND BATTERY DRANNING FAST then i visit service center they told me your phone is physically damage so now out of warrenty my phone body damage in corner slightly but they told me now whole phone out of warrenty and not ready to accept and i told him give me the same thing in on paper they reject my request and told me we are not authorize for this.. 
NOW TELL IF ANY THING HAPPEN WITH ME DUE TO OVERHEATING WHO IS REPOSIBLE FOR THIS 
SO I REQUEST DONT BUY ANY LENOVO PRODUCT ..... BAKWAS BRAND... 
 its my mistake to buy this product, this is worst mobile i have ever seen.anybody reading this please tell all your circle to stay away from this brand.... 
 Camera is not good i am getting blur when i am taking pictures, if you compromise for camera rest every thing is good for this price. 
 with out Quality checking lenovo mobiles send to coustemers,my mobile phone received and inserted the battery it is not switched on,Return policy also very terrific,customer care support also very poor. 
 Worst service from flipkart customer care.
They mentioned "30 day Replacement Guarantee" but if any problem in mobile they won't accept ur reason. 
 I have purchased a smartphone LENEVO A6000 plus bearing the order no. OD203587599446565800 dated 08.08.2015 which%"0was delivered on 14th august,2015. After receiving the product which found in Lenevo A6000 packing instead of Lenevo A6000 plus. But the confusion soon made clear by physically checked the RAM & ROM. After using 1st day in the very beginning of 2nd day the touch screen seems to be not working partially. 
Some parts of my screen do not respond at times but after a few hours it again starts responding. I have decided to return the same by flipkart return policy(Return ID: 27313859)). The representative called me next day ask to do Factory RESET. He shared the troubleshooting steps which i did exactly but i could not find any solution regarding the touch screen issue. But the representative close my return request without my consent or without solving the problem.
 As the return request ( (Return ID: 27584079)) the representative called me over phone and asked me to carry out the installation of Smartchk App. I did exactly what he told me over phone and check the functionality of the touch screen and also asked me to perform system update. Then he instructed me to switch OFF and ON the phone and check the problems whether the issue resolve or not. But unfortunately the problem is still not solved and few portions of 5 inch screen are not working. This time also flipkart close my return request again. But i have put another return request ( (Return ID: 27894350) ( 4th time ) to inform you that I did factory reset, I did system update, I did install smart chk....now whats the next........
Today they again called me and asked me to bring the phone to service centre. But the question is that why should I go to service centre. Why should 
Today your representative asked me to take out the phone to service centre. 
Do you think its a good idea to bring the phone to service centre.Your people are kept my life with troubles for the last 7-8 days. If you go to history you can see I have put 5 times return request , everytime you bring a msg to me that We have shared a few troubleshooting steps that'll help fix the issue you've been facing. But how can i make you understand that it has not been solved. If i go to service centre definitely they will take remedial measures to correct the problem. But then why are you saying that there is a return policy. I think you please let me know the procedure of make you understand that i stated true. How can i prove myself . 
Now you are going to tell me by having this msg that we will get back to you and short out your issue. But issue is still here.  
Now The question is that
1. Where is flipkart friendly return policy.
2. Why problem is not rectified after factory reset.
3. why should I go to service center as the product is very new.
4. Why should I go for factory reset as the mobile is very new.
5. Why return request close without resolving the problems.
Is flipkart wants me to submit the return policy again and again or making it up to the expiry date of return. Atlast today I come to know thae your return policy is not valuable for Electronics item at any cost. 
I am totally irritated, frustrated, upset with this circumstances. I had purchased so many items from flipkart but i never had such kind of absurd situation.  
 Firstly i bought Lenovo A6000 on the very first sale and i was really very impressed with the looks for just 7k. Built quality was ok for the price but specs were really great. 
After a month or two, i again ordered the same phone and was happy with it. Again in march i ordered redmi 2 and to be honest redmi 2 was a perfect blend of built quality, looks and performance. Due to some reasons i replaced the redmi 2 and Lenovo A6000 Plus was in the market. 
As A6000 was the great device for me, i thought Plus will be much better than that. But was extremely disappointed to see that the finishing and built quality was suffered. I replaced the phone for 5 times as there were very minor problems which i din't expected from Lenovo. Firstly there was a air gap between bezel and display of the phone, after that, the replacement i received was again having a flash problem; flash was loose, it was making a tickling kind of noise every time you hold your device or keep it back or throw on your bed. And again i asked for replacement, but this time they provided me with refund. Again i ordered the same, and the back cover fitting was not proper, there was a gap in bottom part of the cover and flash problem also existed, so replaced it again. The replacement i received was again faulty, display was scratched...! I was literally irritated by flipkart, again got the refund.  
Again ordered the same phone and this time it was a used phone....!!! Seal was tampered and box was taped with a transparent plastic tape...! So decided to quit flipkart...and asked for the refund..!! Flipkart asked me to ship product to their place as there was no logistic service available in our area according to flipkart...! And this was the second time flipkart asked me to do ship product to banglore. For the first time i shipped the phone via fedex, costed rs.222 for that and the money was refunded in flipkart wallet. You can use this for future orders and applicable only if you buy product from the specific seller i.e, W.S. Retail. Height of frustration....!!!!!!! 
It was a hectic time i have gone through, and all thanks to flipkart. 
But i personally liked the very much and again dared to go for it. This time i payed via debit card and hence rs.222 was less as it was in flipkart wallet. 
Ordered a white one this time and was surprised to see the premium looking white back panel and thankfully this time i received a good piece whit no such flaws. 
Alright people, this was the story, cant't expect much quality and finishing for a budget phone; but motorola still provides a rugged moto e for 5k, although it lacks the specs but provides a tough phone with zero built quality and finishing issues. 
I hope everyone is very much clear about A6000 Plus's performance and specs...Thumbs up for the same...!! 
A humble request for flipkart; please provide a section where people can upload images in their reviews. 
Thank You...

 Hi All, 
i am using this phone from past 15 days. from last 5 days i am facing heating issue and phone is switching off every 15 min i placed a complete to flipkart but flipkart told me to check in service center and closed my case. 
i never know WS retails is no cheater
where is the 30 days replacement. . 
 Don't buy A6000 plus lot of hardware issue. I purchased this phone and realized that it is heating up too much even if the phone is kept idle and battery was draining very fast. 
Suddenly phone is not charging i have given handset to service center diagnose the problem in mobile phone mother board problem and replacement take 15 days
my suggestion don't buy A6000+ better is A7000 as compair these phone 
 The Specification looks attractive... Even the phones looks good aesthetically.. But that ends there... I was very skeptical before ordering this phone since I had earlier bought Lenovo A6000 which I got it replaced thrice & believe me all the three phones had the same problem (mic not audible)... I was totally disappointed...
Now this one yes knowingly I made a very big mistake to buy this one.. 
Touch screen is not working on arrival... I have requested for a replacement & I'm waiting to see how replacement phone works.. I will certainly update if I find any problem even with the replaced phone.. 
I strongly recommend please don't buy any of these cheap Chinese phones with Lenovo branding..  
Update: After replacement
Even the replaced phone is having touch problem & when Flipkart Executives checked it through smart check app the it showed that there is no problem with the phone..
Hence replacement disapproved.. 
I suggest people not to buy any Lenovo products.. 
 worst service witnessd till now from flipkart. I orderd a piece of lenovo 6000 plus and suddenly without any prior notice they cancelled my order not giving me any reason for the same after keeping me waiting for a week. I orederd another fresh piece for second time and this time they gave me a date 15 days later and that too colour was not available 
 There was no earphone in the Box and received the products in Allahabad city in 10 days. Phone features are good. 
 I booked Lenovo A6000Plus It is booked on 23rd June... till date it is not shiped from the Seller... Seller is too late in shiping the product. 
Waste Service. 
 TOO LATE DELIVERY 7 DAYS AGO NO START STATUS PRODUCT WAS NOT RECIVE CUSTMOR NOT RESPOND ON MY PHONE I AM TRY DAILY 5 TIMES MY PHONE TOTALY CUT ON FLIPKART CUSTMAR CARE SORRY SORRY TODAY SEND TODAY SEND DAILY TALK WITH ME BUT NOT SEND 
 LENOVO A6000 PLUS I WAS PURCHASED AND AFTER SOME DAY MOBILE WAS HEAT AND CHARGING NOT PROPER. I HAVE COMPLAIN TWO TIME ABOUT IT BUT FLIPKART CUSTOMER CARE EXECUTIVE REJECT MY COMPLAIN TWO TIME. 
VERY BAD EXPERIENCE OF THIS PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT.  
 This is the worst mobile. I have bought it two months back. It suddenly gets switched off.. Out no reason ...!!! .and I had to remove my battery and switch it again, So when I reported the same to Flip-kart and they replaced my phone with new piece,.. I was happy for that.. Same problem with my new phone also.. It got switched off nearly 10 times yesterday. I had to remove battery each time and switch on again..!! WTH...! Why for me... ?!!! 
 I am a regular buyer from Flipkart and I was very happy with my purchase until I purchased this product. This has disappointed me totally. The phone delivered to me is of very poor quality, it hangs very frequently. Takes days to charge and once charged gets discharged very quickly. Raised a complaint and it was rejected without giving any reason. The support team had initially said they will call to fix the issue later in the day and no one called back and sent an sms that the return is rejected. 
 I bought it about a month ago and it was automatically turning off every 3-4 days even if charged and placed on table (i.e. no jerk). I got it replaced 4 days back. Now this new phone is also automatically turning off. Why God Why?? 
UPDATE: 23/6
It's not power off as one has to either remove the battery or press the power button for 15 seconds to get it back. So, it seems to be hang/freeze issue. It occurs when it's connected to wifi and gets to sleep mode. So, turned off battery saving during wifi in advanced settings.
UPDATE: 26/6
Changing the settings didn't help, as the phone went to sleep of death(i.e. freeze with black screen) again today with 75% charge. 
UPDATE: 28/6
Asked flipkart for replacement again. The call-person did factory reset of the phone. 
 Hi, 
I am not getting for the replacement for my newly bought Lenovo A6000 + mobile. 
Order ID: OD202828650684330100
Order Date: 12 May, 2015 5:16 PM 
My phone is dead from yesterday & not getting charged.
After logging the request for replacement Flipkart technical person says that they will not replace it as they don't find any issue. 
Now my question is that how can they say that they don't find any issues with a dead phone & deny for replacement when it is still under replacement warranty?
Also they deliver the product in my area but don't have any pickup, what kind of service it is?
I have to bear courier charges, I will be left without a phone for about 5-6 days(atleast) in such replacement. 
I will be surely taking it as example for future & will not make any order with flipkart.
If possible I will also be going for any legal actions against it. 
Regards,
Manish Bansal?  
 Attention please !!!! Listen Listen give you time for two min it may help you from being fraud. 
And if you have already buy please check its WIFI HOTSPOT AND USB TETHERING its not working its very important whenever you are on destination travelling and if you rae technical person with you other gadgets. 
My request to all customer who is reading this review don't buy this product if you wast your time and money.  
 Dont buy from Flipkart and lenovo and WS Retailer because my personal experience last one month. I ordered Lenevo A6000 Plus on 28th April. I am web professional.I have specially bought lenovo A6000 plus for hotspot and tethering use for my laptop and other gadgets but its not working the device was facing connectivity problem.Very bad device don't purchase it.
 Lenovo A6000 plus has also battery draining and heating issue.I have contacted flipkart customer care they cant resolved issue. I have also visited lenovo service center many times but they told our server is down.  
 Totally this device very costing me because my work and business stopped then they told that they will call back for refund but till not come call from flipkart.I demand my refund for this device. I call every day to flipkart 2 times everyday but they do not give answer so flipkart customer care service is very bad. 
Then they give me replacement but replacement item also defective WIFI HOTSPOT and USB TETHERING technical team has taken more time but after technical team rejected my refund request they told me that you don't know how to use but i am web developer and technology mind person but i am sure HOTSPOT AND USB TETHERING issue in this product should be in every peace.  
 First time this product you face very good in budget but its wrong you fill sure very bad experience after buy it. All are Chinese product you know very well abut Chinese product.  
Ye dekhne aur sunneme achhi lagti hai but use karnke me achhi nahi hai  
Please don't buy lenovo products and don't buy from FLIPKART and don't buy CHINESE PRODUCT and don't buy from WS RETAILER its very bad service from both. 
 I used this phone from last week, it has heating problem every time it heated a lot. I raised a request for return and refund but one of flipkart executive rejected my return request. Now I will put this incident on social media platform, blogger, my website and classified site. 
As flipkart screwed me I will spoil it's goodwill it is not a big task for me, as a SEO expert to publish an article...  
 I ordered the product on 12th May but still haven't got the product and after repeated followup they are telling there is a Mismatch in PINCODE and address but I used to get the product with the same details earlier.  
On 17th they telling the product will be delivered by 21st even they can't send the product 1 day delivery also. 
Finally I think they don't have the products but they sold and kept our Money with them.\
It is the worst service I am getting& response from call center. 
 Received a faulty product, but the interesting factor is Flipkart is not taking any steps from May 4 to replace the product, which was not expected. I always opted Flipkart because of their service support, yet to be caution in future orders. A warning for the customers..... 
 With extreme sorrow I am writing this review to bring your kind notice the sufferings that I had due to irresponsible and highly un-professional conduct from your support and your product.
I would like to mention that I ordered a Lenovo a 6000 plus from flipkart and there is heating issue and battery drain issue.I personally called and requested the cc executive 8 times to fixed the issue or replacement ASAP because it was crucial for me to received it before 10-May-15..
No one here to help you.. 
I would like to mention that my genuine grievance had been unheard and your cc executive and floor manager had shown no interest or enthusiasm in helping me out.Which forces me to write this review ... 
With due respect I am requesting you to replace my product in 24 hours else consider my this purchase to be my last with flipkart.. 
 I had purchased this phone on 28th April sale and received immediately next day. Unfortunately, i received a defective phone and it is getting shut down randomly, the battery back up is also not good. Overall, other phone features are good as compared to its price.
Flipkart is selling the defective products along with WS Retail to earn more money and clear their defective products in the market. They are really cheating the public. Please avoid buying Lenovo a6000 plus or any other products from them. Atleast Lenovo should stop giving their product to Flipkart and WS Retail.
My request for replacement of defective phone is still not addressed which i raised on 4th May with flipkart. The customer care is worst and even don't listen the return request.
I am really losing my time and getting stressed due to Flipkart's poor behavior on my return request.
@Flipkart - Please take my request seriously and do the needful in getting me new phone at the earliest. 
 if u think of to buy this phone seriously u will only get regret. flipkart has worst services and is fake seller they sell more then half of defective products and doesn't take replacement and refund . this phone heats above 50 degree celcius u can check it by *#*#4636#*#* in battery info . and its battery back up it on stand by is 3 hours m not faking u seriously u will only get regret if u buy this product service from lenovo is worst . they reject my replacement request two times. if u buy from amazon and u get defective product they didn't even ask u a single question its ur choice whats u want refund or repacement and u will get it in 2 days , this is only flipkart who makes fool of people by saying that we are apologizing for inconvinienced to you we will solve your issue in next two days and guys that next two days will come after one weak , u become fool by flipkart , there is no flipkart ADVANTAGE scheme by flipkart , cuz there is NO REPLACEMENT for this product . 
 Bought two mobile, one among them is excellent.
The other phone have some issues, I am demanding for replacement seven days back.
I spent Rs. 7500 on this product and expecting good product. 
I am demanding for replacement to the current mobile. 
But Flipkart team saying that their technical team will call me regarding this issue, I have been waiting since a week. But no one called me so far. 
I totally get irritated with Flipkart executives reply and their services. 
This is my first bad experience with Flipkart since two years.  
 Flipkart, this is very much irritating i have ordered the product much before than my friends and i have received the product late compare to my friends 
Product and Package quality is great 
 Awesome experience, my second android after Karbonn A9+ (512 RAM). This phone is quite fast compared to other 2 GB phone. Is user friendly,
16 GB of internal storage(11.53 GB of usable storage.
A free screen guard. .
Dolby Digital Plus Sound
Display is good with 1280x720. 
Supports 4G LTE
light weight(128 grams).
Apps not only can be transferred to SD card, but can be installed directly on SD card as well 
Best in this price range.  
BUT unfortunately returned it back, for key board issue  
 I just got my Lenovo A6000 Plus, and I am very disappointed with the quality of the phone. No earphones with the pack, rear camera quality is just like VGA camera, sound is another negative factor in this set, no dolby digital it is a radio voice. no OTG, WiFi not working, battery is draining like anything. Videos are not playing. Back panel is very cheap, Looks like a toy phone. It has been a poor choice. Above all Flipkart refused to refund the amount. Disgusting..... 
 donot get influenced by its specifications
the actual phone is really very bad
it is a disappointing experience
the camera quality is extremely bad bad bad poor and so on
it is just like a vga camera  
 world's worst device, what lenovo A6000 Plus clam the software which are in the device are there, but the hardware is very poor to handle these all software...... my suggestion is to never go with this device. my points are......
1. heating problem- continue use of device more then 10 min
2. quality of material is very low.
3. camera quality is very poor (in zoom).
4. I don't want to give any star to this product but I have to ( cause without that I am unable to give this valuable review to all my friends who are planning to purchase this device). 
 Don`t by this phone 
very worst product 
This phone is mini heater not mobile 
battery dry quikly  
first five days working in good condition 
Then next days starting the issue one by one 
life time worst product 
please don`t ever by this phone  
 1. Battery Consumption problem, battery charging is very slow and only 3 hours backup from fully charged battery. 
2. Heating problem 
3. Back camera (8 MP) quality is average. images are blur 
4. No Earpiece with phone. 
 I am using A6000, it is good in quality and good performance.but A6000+ has poor wi fi range and poor network, it get heat up on playing games. 
 Internet connective issue, not supporting wifi mobile data, dead slow,, went to service center & they told you return this product. 
 I bought is yesterday and this mobile is very good, espcecially I like the display. Camera front & back are good. It plays 720P or 4K videos well without any haziness. Browising experience is also very good. It is far better than Xiomi & Moto E (2g), in all aspects especially color reproduction & performance wise. Mobile is slim. 
Con: No headset provided in the box
I feel if they provide multiple color back covers that would enhance the mobile's look. 
 Screen guard is not received in this lenovo a6000 plus pack and otherwise product is good & working fine 
 I bought this phone to gift my uncle. Till now the phone is working good no heating issues etc.
the camera quality is what bit disappointing. 
 All Pros and Pros.. Looks, Touch, Battery, etc. everything nice.. good budget phone at this price..
Cons: But There is no charging indicator light.. you can never know if the phone is charging. every time you have to swipe the screen and see charging on or not..
Front camera should have been 5MP selfie..
Should have been factory loaded with 5.0 Lollypop.  
 I USED LENOVO A6000 NOW USING LENOVO A6000 PLUS
CAMRA QUALITY IS VERY DOWN IN PLUS VER WHILE PERFECT IN A6000 
 This Mobile both (Rear And Front) Camera Quality Very Bad And Battery Backup very bad.
Pls not buy any Person this product.You want this price mobile pls buy Mi Redmi 2 Prime 
mi moblie camera and battery very very good compare this mobile. 
 This Phone has Excellent features...I would always love to buy Lenovo mobile phones....This mobile phone has excellent features... 
 After month of use, the touch screen stopped working. 
Rebooted, formatted and resetted and did everything. No Use. Can't Return since its more than 30 days. Went to Lenovo Service Centre in Kolkata Parstreet and found out its a single service centre for HCL, RedMi, Leneno and dozens of other mobiles. Long Queue . 
EXTREMELY DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED. PLEASE DONT BUY ANY LENOVO PRODUCTS. USELESS FIRM. NO GOOD SERVICE CENTRE. 
 1) Charging takes more than 5 hours
2) Battery drains within 3 hours
3) heating in such way that you cannot make calls or put into pocket
4) results remain same even though data connection is off 
 lenovo a6000 plus very good phone @ price 7500/-
new camera quality back both fornt camera.
nice battary backup.
every thing is very good..
but in this lenovo a6000 plus 
i have facing heating problem.
when i am doing charge,playing game, and do any thing with lenovo a6000 plus handset..
when going to soo heated....
can u tell me what to do for that 
 my phone is only 21 days old, and many problem is here, mainly notification problem and touch is not working. don't waste your money. 
 I have bought Lenovo A6000 Plus from flipkart and It was delivered by 2nd July 2015. After picking the product once I tried to use this Phone, It was getting heat just within 10-15 Mins.
When I used and found heavy heating issue with the phone and Battery backup. believe me ! Heating issue is that much We cant take it in hand like Its going to burn.I have read some of customers reviews They also written same things.
As I spoken with the flipkart team They said that their Tech Support team will contact to me within 24 Hours.
I got call from your tech support He was very hurry to disconnect the call and He was not interested to listen my query He was just like completing his call target for his job instead of helping to customers' issue.
I was following to flipkart team last 4 days but no one was responding me properly. As I spoken with the flipkart team that I want to return this product and I really dont want this product anymore and I want my money back.
After all Next couple of hours I got a call from Tech Support and He make me downloaded a Application Smart Check for Trouble Shooting.
As per their system my Phone is normal and product can not be returned.It was like me They are making me fool. A Customer is facing from last 4 days and He just like has done the crime by purchasing product from flipkart. End of the point They are not accepting at all. He was routed to service center.
Service center visiting is not my resolution If I would need to go service center so Why should I purchase from flipkart. I have bough new Phone, there is no need to go service centre. I have paid for 7499rs/ 
 Sim1 slot is detecting the sim card but no network.
Damm bad battery quality.
After 100% charging it took 30 minutes for battery @ 10% (No wifi, gps, data is on)
Now phone is in lenovo service center (2 months from purchase) from last 3 days. 
 Dear readers/buyers, with my experience I am posting the review with a opinion atleast some other buyers should get cheated like me. Screen Display is very bad and it is shady and pixels is worst. If you widen the screen display to a minimum size also quality is poor. 
Further they are sending lenovo A6000 model only and not A6000plus. 
Never buy and by looking add. Go 
 performance is very good...stylish design
rear camera is very bad front cam is very nice
battery backup is very nice  
 ye ek bakwas phone he. dosto bhulkar bhi kharid mat lena. mene 2 set kharide the dono hi bakwas. naam bade or darsan chote. 1 mahine me hi hang hone lage he. bar bar reset karne padte he. 1 mahine me hi bimar pad gaya ye phone. service center ki jarurat padne lagi he is phone ko. 
 I have purchased this model @7499/- from Flipkart. A company nice design for attracting the mobile users for this model. Only attracting the smart phone users, performance is very bad at this price range. Honor B is better than this model in very less price. If you select honor B you can save Rs.3000/-. 
Cons: 
Heating Problem,
Voice call disturbance
Ram only 1.25 GB and remaining used system
Rom only 11.85 GB and remaining used system
Primary Camera is very bad 5MP camera phones is better than this model.
I am not interesting to give stars for this model Lenovo A6000Plus at this price. 
Positive:
Front Camera
Phone designing
Light Weight 
 I brought this product on first sale but after one month i observed that at a specific spot on screen touch is not working 
And returns date also expired 
 Hello  
I alread spoke to the flikart executive. 
Still I am facing issue , when I was in call my ear is getting heavy pain due to mobile ..If anything is happen his mobile. Please you guys will take responsible. 
I have to visit lenova care atleast..I had worrest experiance with fil[pkart. 
Please let me know I will give you my mobile free of cost..selll it to any one. 
Good bye  
 1. Not happy with flipkart service as they shipped material after 7 days form the date of order. If you dont have product in stock then you should keep listing it under registration mode. my money just enjoyed for 7 days. 
For product 
So... happy. 
Good things
1. excellent display
2. Best UI ( If you love MiUi then this is something clone of the same UI )
3. Super fast ( 2GB RAM & 16GB ROM ).
4. Battery ( its above expectation - you can use full day without any issue and there will be more charge available )
5. Camera ( some of the review says camera is OK but compare to many brands its much much better. )
6. Light weight ( when you hold the phone it gives you premium feel as well as so light weighted though love to carry it ).
7. Sound quality ( so crystal clear talk experience and Dolby sound give good musical experience ) 
Things missed
1. Gorilla glass ( we have to appy tempered glass saperatly )
2. OGS should be there ( even very thin mobile )
3. heating ( remember many review says its heat up very much but as per my experience it heats when you use the handset during charging or different charger ).
4. back lit key missing. 
Predicts 
at the price of 7.5K its like gifting you 20K handset. pls don't wast your money in other product. go with this. 
 SOUND QUALITY IS NOT GOOD....OTHERS ARE GOOD...BATTERY IS EXCELLENT ..FRONT CAMERA NOT AS LIKE AS 8 MP... 
 Touch not responding properly. Wifi not connected properly.The technical team simply asked us to reset/reboot the set. Flipkart may furnish their email ID for further correspondence. 
 1st of all phone is not getting charged its show charging symbol but not getting charged and top of we have to wait till 24 hours product team will call unsatisfied 
 I ordered Lenovo A6000 Plus and I have received it in time but surprisingly Such a BIG NAME in IT Field (i.e. LENOVO) has no time to upgrade the MOBILE ID as i could not find A6000 Plus mentioned on it except on top of the BOX with sticker only.
I mean to say even in settings -> about phone -> Model information it shows A6000 for the mobile which i ordered A6000 PLUS. 
No one from flipkart is able to resolve my query raised in this regards . They asked me to talk to service centre and there also they have no idea for it. I am really surprised for such a Technical Error from Lenove/Flipkart. 
PL. HELP ME TO HAVE RIGHT PRODUCT WITH RIGHT MODEL ID.
HEATING OF THE DEVICE IS ANOTHER ISSUE.  
 The batttery of this phone is not upto the extent. Phone starts heating up very early. Sound quality of this phone is also not that much good. Suggest not to buy this phone. Camera is fine. 
 after using it for two weeks, this will be the review given by me
the phone is good with almost 1.40 ram 11.4 gb rom
the phone is very over haeting 
it is slightly hanging 
worst back panel
no backlit
no ear phones 
 Battery Backup - Bullshit ( I used Nokia 1600 4 days with backup)
Battery - Heats up quickly its time to Explode (Thinking to Handover the device to terrorist)
Speaker- Its not a Dolby its a radio shitty
Display - The worst (When we cover the display with hand we cant see anything)
OS - Hang every time ( If I capture a screenshot of display menu the icons on it cant be rearranged ) 
Wifi/ Data connection - Not working (WIFI- Its shows wifi not available and DataConnection - please insert sim ) 
For 7K price its the worst Smartphone
Go for Redmi / Moto 
Ordered Lenovo A6000 Plus Got my Flashsale Product 
Thanks to thumbs down reviewers as Im happy with my decision that im not your prey......  
Negatives
Fingerprint - Use Tempered Glass protector 8-9H for a6000/plus.....
Bottom Buttons ledlight - Use Ciggar Lighter in Dark.......
No Headset- Still wont satisfy with what received for 1Re....but ?....
OTG support - Hope Loli will clear it.....
Themes - An update can...... 
From 20K to 7K - Fully Satisfied........Because im a value investor......  
 hey guyz . everything of this phone is good for the price and the only problem i faced was the sound clarity ..its loud enough but not clear*
.speaker flatters under high volume levels (max)
. dolby .i feel no difference .
.redmi 2 sound is better than this ... 
 Phone is getting discharged very soon. Even if I get it 100 percent charge and do nothing for the next 8-10 hours with it, the remaining battery will be only 5 or 6%. All other features are of no use because of the battery issue. Please look for alternative. 
 Overall satisfied with all the quality the phone have, its very light and slim phone.
No heating and no lags issues. Some features are quite impressive. 
Only a small thing that Lenovo should provide a earphone with the phone.
For Phone 5 star
For Flipkart service 5 star 
If lenovo can provide a earphone to all customers it will make a great impact with the phone. 
 1. camera quality is not good in night u will not clear snaps (very bad quality)
2. battery can run 14 to 1 6 hrs 
3. if u talk more than 10 mins mobile tem will go more than 48 deg
4. 2g and 3g internet speed is very slow
5. cheap hardware used by lenovo
6. voice call is not good very low voice comes during talk and u cant hear ringtones  
 Got the product on 30th Apr 2015, Very light weighted, However 2G speed was very very slow and App download were very slow. 
 its good one at this price range and the best part is the display is wonderful, battery life is very good and cam is also better even at lowllight conditions it gives u some wonderful shots ,with the ram being 2gb the os is fluid and unlike miui vibe is doesnot give u a chineese look feel 
 Looks stylish.
Performs well.
Good Display.
Light Weight.
Gives rich look.
camera(enough for normal clicks)  
 it is the best phone in budget.
plus points
5 inches
thin and slim design
2 gb ram
16 gb rom 
8 mp rear and 2 mp front camera
responsive
negative points 
not very long lasting battery 
no notification light
no earphone in the box
and backlight button
but I should say that it improve itself very much from previous version  
 Please do not sale like. Don't fool the people. 
@ Flipkart dont do this in future for your customers 
 Update as on 25th sept,2015: So I decided to replace the memory card from a 8GB to 32 GB and to copy the data to backup was the most tedious process over 3 hours and no data moved,Finally I had to use my Mother's Micromax Canvas A114 phone to transfer data to system which was 1GB RAM phone and has outperformed the lenovo phone 
Seems like Flipkart has made a big fool of us by launching the "Flash Sale" 
Update after 3 months of usage: GPS is almost pathetically non functional with 2G data ... GPS works fine with Wifi haven't tried with 3G..  
There is no use of this phone if you are a frequent traveller and are relying on GPS for directions, you get this voice very often "GPS SIGNAL LOST" 
I was very excited to see this phone but unfortunately no headset :(  
There are plenty of sites which give a performance review etc. 
But if you are using this phone for music purpose, be prepared to shell out extra for a "Good" Quality headset.  
Please read the fine print on specification , because once you buy, You can only get replacement for the same NOT refund . 
3/3 for Ekart logistics for fast delivery   
 Lenovo reviews look like fraud 
Today i got this phone i got problem:
1. Sound Quality Problem
2. Ring Tone very Low
3. No EAR PHONE in Box.
4. No LED Notification. (They Making Fool to us by Photos- in photo we can see LED NOTIFICATION -but in REAL lenovo Not given Notification LED) 
i received call from Flipkart they said to RRESET my Phone Settings so i did RESET phone settings but after that same problem NOT SOLVED. 
now im going to return to this product. better i like to get back my MONEY. Im very upset. 
 NICE SPECS WITH A GOOD PRICE.BUT QUALITY WISE ITS NOT UP TO THE MARK,
1.SCREEN RESPONSIVE TIME IS NOT SO GOOD
2.THERE IS SOME LAG IN GRAPHICS
3.WITH 2GB RAM AND QUAD CORE PROCESSOR ITS NOT WORKING LIKE OTHER BRANDED MOBILE WITH SAME CONFG..
3.ITS BUILD QUALITY IS NOT SOLID.
4.XIOAMI MOBILES ARE BETTER BUILD QUALITY THAN LENOVO
5.AFTER 10 MINUTES OF GAMING ITS GOT HEATED .
6.THERE IS NO LOLIPOP OUT OF THE BOX. 
 A6000plus is bang for the Buck, but its specifications upgrade is good.
Its everything of A6000 with added RAM 1 to 2 and storage of 8 to 16 GB  
The Flipside is, the 2300mah Li- Po battery offered in the international market is down to a Li-ion battery in India.
Yes go on dumping all low quality, Highly hazardous material in Indian land and rivers.- to die of pollution first. 
Why the quality differs for India? Are we cheap?  
Couldn't find A6000plus official specs in any of the Lenovo's sites (national/ US) as on 7thMay2015, it is just done to cover up their Racial discrimination  
Suggest to name it as A6000MinusPlus so that we can understand Lenovo has stripped certain quality for Indians
I'm reducing 2stars for Lenovo's attitude with racial discrimination 
 i just bought this phone few days back, display is good, voice quality is good, phone is light weighted. All feature looks nice But device getting heated very quickly. 
 I bought it from flipkart battery life for this phone even without 3G/4G just wifi with occasionally connected drains out in 3 hours 
 Received the phone yesterday but not happy with performance.
Touch is lagging.
Colour Display is poor.
No call settings found 
 I hAVE ORDERED LENOVO 6000 PLUS WITH PAYMENT DONE IN ADVANCED
BY SBI CARD TO GET FURTHER 10% DISCOUNT
BUT WHEN I OPENED THE BOX EARPHONE WAS MISSING FROM SET 
 Don't Install lollipop version....it may not support that version....the problems u may face like 1.true caller app is not suitable for lollipop version....for two months it's good, after its difficult to dial a number.u have to press more n more times. 2. Even u update any app it's not getting updated app. For example MX player. Even u update dat app after playing some video it's getting restart. 3.when my mobile is new its very excellent in video recording but after few month it's very difficult to record video.After recording 30sec it's automatically restarts mobile sometimes after 10seconds u may get problem. 4.battery is not bad 
 However the SIM1 sot supports 2g/3g/4g but the sim2 slot supports only 2g. This is hectic as I normally use dual sim of two different network providers, and there are areas where 3g is unavailable for some networks providers. 
 Such a nice phone, no heating problem. i enjoyed a lot. Good packing. Working condition is also good. First they send one piece its give the problem within a week i would request to replacement they were respond promptly send the new piece. 
 This phone is awsm at this price range.....non of the phone is comparable as
#8MP,which is very sharp & clear
#2MP,front camera is so decent
#battery backup is just awsm its give a full 24 hours backup after moderate usage
#1.2gb ram is always free which is very good
#never lags or hang
#a very light weight & handy phone
#but the buttons are not very responsive.....
#doesn't support OTG 
 It is a very nyc product moreover its a worthit phone with good feature as well lenovo quality , but lenovo have work on camera its good but not as expected 
 the mobile was delivered 2day it had all manuals,USB cable, 2 wall pin charger, Battery as it was said in general features. But earphones are missing................... 
 Phone is good in this price range 
But the service of lenevo s very bad . please upgrade to lollipop it is better for this mobile. 
 It is a good product value of money at this price range every thin in this phone is good.
The feel on hands is very comfortable with its Matte back and its super light.
1.Fast Processing and Good storage, no lags
2.Good Front and rear camera, nice flash also.
3.Excellent Sound Quality earphone, speaker, Dobly feature is awesome.
4.Good battery backup. lasts for a day with moderate use
5.HD display is amazing.
6.Good Screen touch, not felt much difference with my earlier, shows smartphone market improved a lot.
7.No heat, not much heating compare to other phones
8.Lite weight phone.
9.Not Hanged till date with 20 days of use. 
 Excellent working, it is Paisa Wasul product, i suggest to my friend for this product. its good to use. 
 I have it & i love it... ;-) Best smartphone under 8000/- and the features of the phone is preety awsm also...if u want a awsm android around 8000rs...this is the perfect choice... 
 the product is very nice and after using for a such long period i am fully satisfied with the product. 
 Gud as per paper. But doesnt sound enough in reality. Except camera evrything is fine enough. For low budget just go for it.. white panel looks cool 
 Device is good, this is also very very light weight. In this budget the phone with 2gb RAM is fine but ROM i.e. internal memory showing 16gb but we get it only 4gb(appx) 
 lenovo 6000 plus is good mobil
good bettary life
nice locking 
nice camera , image quility
everything very good product 
 Very Good...!!! 
Good Front and rear camera, nice flash also.
Good battery backup. lasts for a day with moderate use
Not much heating compare to other phones.
Lite weight phone. 
Worth full for that price...  
 I bought a Lenovo A6000 plus model, it provided a good suffer to me.
There had enough features in the comfortable price.
I am very happy to say that I bought another same model for my bro.
Thank u flipkart.. 
 Yes, worth for money, worked good everyday... and no issues with respect to call and 4G speed is good and consitant. 
 it is a very good product. good battery life. camera is very clear. phone is very light and thin. screen is clear. at this price range with 4g it is a very good option. 
 It has been some 7-8 months since I have been using Lenovo A6000 plus. Well what stands out for me are its overall features be it camera, display, battery, durability et al in the given budget. The only lag that I have witnessed is that once you have upgraded its software, the phone's performance has slowed down. However, overall a compact package to have!! 
 i had a bitter experience after updating the software. 
the speaker was not woking after the software update. 
the service center people took to much time and i got it back in useable condition after 25 days. 
lenovo should check the product and its quality to avoid these kind of issues. 
 I've been using this phone as my primary phone and it has a pathetic battery life. The battery drains within 3 hours. Moreover when I took my phone to the service centre they kept it for 5 days and returned me with a software update and I am still facing the same problem.  
Worst battery
Worst after sale support 
Camera changes alot of colors  
Though there is no performance issue on this phone it runs smooth.  
Conclusion- go for another phone  
 Light weight mobile easy handling thanks
But without headphone ........... 
 I was purchasing this phone.. This phone soo hang and very bad touch.. Over all this pgone is soo bad phone please dont purchasing this phone 
 I used this product almost an year. I didn't face any problems till now. This is really the nice one. 
 After some time ,it starts overheating and switches off automatically, I suggest not to buy on this site 
 Believe me this product actually delivers superblt for what it has to offer through its specifications. But for only one reason I didnt give it 5 star bcz it does not have any notification light. 
 Bought 3 phones. All working good. Something you can really trust !!!
Very nice phone. 
Only drawback is it dont have a gorrilla glass. But decent with the proce its is selling. 
 I used this phone since 1 month. no problem found till now. its a very good product. especially cameras are very very good. thank u lenovo, thank u flipkart 
 Awesome camera super battery backup and light weight

i suggested to my friends go for lenovo a6000plus they have also bought this model of lenovo..

Cons - 
Screen quality is not so good.
Volume is too low
Camera is average

 The best value for money phone. The phone runs android KitKat and can be upgraded to lollipop. 
 Very good phone and totally worth the price. Good battery backup and excellent camera quality 
 Received a faulty peice at first but got it exchanged via flipkart and it has been working well . It is a good phone. 
 Nice product to buy under 10000 rupees.
Nice phone to use ruf and tuf 
 Fast delivery with geniun product....nice phone actually 
Great 
 Good product for given cash, and also fast delivery were made by E kart with safe packing.
In common,Flipkart have super retailer such as WS Retails.That is all 
 I am an often user of moto devices and hve a bunch of collection of it but lenovo was new for me accordingly to what I thought it went reverse 
The phone is quite good handy and easy to use gives a good look without u put a often a sorted cover u purchase so for me it found a good one !! 
 very poor battery .. its been less than 5months I bought this.. and the battery gets drained within 4 hours. I cannot go for sleep without keeping the phone for charging. and if i speak for 5 minuts... this becomes and iron box.! pretty hot. 
 super battery backup, high performance, super picture quality, economy, attractive colors
but when you go for phone information it is displaying only a6000 instead of a 6000 plus 
 Performance is somewhat appealing in this price group. But the processor heats up vry quickly. Very average camera performance, both of them. Good battery life. Touch response is also less than average, u can't play games like Piano Tiles 2! Good for lite gaming. 
 I have recieved product us good nice looking phone... After updating no hanging issue 
 I brought 3 phones and all are working well
Best phone at this price thanks to Lenovo & flipkart for giving such a great phone.. 
 Very good phone, Good display, memory and build quality. The sound 
 could have been better, Despite Dolby, not very good sound quality. The 8-megapixel camera is pretty impressive. Overall complete value for the money paid. 
 mobile is osm not that much heating..but some what heating...still now no probs worth to buy......lenevo a6000 plus is the old model but no bugs to fix and it looks pretty good.....my money is not wasted.. 
 Lenovo has bought us a fair, powerfull, slim phone which will be liked by all ages of people. Some times we can't identify where the phone really is because of its low weight. The % inch screen gives it a high class look and style. The dolby speakers provide decent sound to its users. The major advantage of online buyers is that, this mobile phone;s availability in retail shops is low. 
The overall performance is Good. 
 Very good phone... A complete package of features. A recommended product.. And flipkart's fast delivery is much appreciated! 
 its mobile camera quality is very bad and also battery backup. if you use continue 3 or 4 hours then its give some problems like hang. 
 Although they advertise this phone with dolby speakers, the speakers are not up to the mark compared to phones like moto G. The phone lacks sound. Ring volume is very very low. Even with max volume, without headsets, with the speaker, the sound level is very less. 
The android lollipop comes with a lot of bugs. ring volume automatically comes down after I remove my headset. It should automatically go up after I remove my headset. But do not do so. 
 This phone is good comparative to it's price but I found that after upgradation of lolipop it will heating up very much. 
 I recieved from flip kart with in specified time.Coming to the phone specifications It was amazing and this is the phone I want to buy and found myself buying this great phone, 
 Relay very good phone with all features.
Display clarity is amazing. I gifted to my wife on our marriage anniversary. He is so amazed after seeing this phone. It's voice is loud and clear. Work very fast. It has in build many useful apps so you don't needs to download from play store. 
 Best phone of lenovo.battery backup is superb.display is good.tottaly awesome. 
 its a very nice mobile with 5 inch screen size,nice touch and light weight.best thing about the mobile is best for the range under 7500 rupees of mobile 
 The phone works perfectly. Only, had to update from android lollipop. Had some problems with the delivery, but got it on the specified date. 
 best value of product and price,,,,
but there is no earphone in this box of mobile,,,,
thats a problem of earphone is not in the box,,,,,,, 
 nice specification for this range.... good clarity display.. but camera is not much good... 1gb ram is available free after installing many apps... some times heating problems occurs but after clearing the previous apps it goes normal.. 
 over heating & touch is not @ satisfactory level i will prefer moto version for this same cost and even low 
 Easy operating system, fast browsing and fast in pying games, nice performance, long battery life.
Friendly user interface. Nice sound clarity. Good capturing & nice image quality. 
 Phone is really nice..its better performer then micromax
Dolby sound has been mentioned in specification but its not really good speakers..sound is good on earphones. 
 Service is good .
got the product with in 24 hours of purchase .
regualrly getting all offers mail from flipkart
Nice Phone tih 2 GB RAM and 16 GB ROM 
 good product by flipkart. fast delivery..........................................
this product doesn't give the headset 
 I really liked this phone. Amazing product at this price. Nice screen size amazing touch and battery life. 
 the phone is very light and handy....
audio speakers are good it has dual speakers on the phone..
battery backup is not bad runs almost the whole day without recharge although my net is on all the time....
have not tested with with too many games except for the usual temple run which runs smooth....
no low memory issues yet..... 
in the box u will find the phone its charger and warranty card with another manual booklet....no headset or handsfree comes with this model... the charger is good not the same color as the phone though 
 I went through the entire Specs and was little skeptical based on input from some of my friends who said touch screen goes for a challenge post some time. I bought it for my Dad and he is not a whatsapp savvy or game savvy to touch so much... battery is good ...screen is good... camera not so great...yet a good one.

 Pros:
Camera good, 
battery average
Cons:
Hanging most of time
Heating most of time  
 battery is very weak of this phone, get consumed within 1 hr even after 100% charging.
Not worth, chinese phnis better than Lenovo 
 I'm using this phone from last 8-9 months and no issues till now.
I have also updated android version and its appearance is now more attractive and more features are now available.
No hang problem, is running stream-full.
Camera Quality is not so good, can only get results in day light.
Video Voice capture is also not good.
Overall phone appearance is good, lit weighted and gets charged just in 1 and half hour.
Battery outcome is also fine. 
 This phone has a good build quality. It is a decent product at decent price. Biggest plus point speakers are better than other cell phones of same segment. 
 I have been using this phone for the last six months.  
The device is very slow when we have multiple operations. So decided to exchange the same with another device through flipkart. Shockingly, this is not available to be exchanged with a new handset. 
 Fast shipping. Nice product and no problem at all. Phone running smooth................................................................................................................................................................................................................. 
 A6000 is very good product of Lenovo , more than its price. very suitable and budgeted phone , i suggest to my friends . 
 Front Camera - 3.5/5
Back Camera - 4.0/5
Touch - 4/5 
Battery - 4/5
Apps Handling- 4.5/5
Call Quality - 4.5/5
Screen Quality- 3.5/5
Overall a Good phone for rough and tough use. Go for it. 
@Otherwise@ 
Buy Redmi 2 Prime that is only product similar to Lenovo A6000 Plus otherwise no phone rencounter this in same price range. 
 Best product at best price you can go for lenovo with this price 
 It has no problem. I'm using this phone since last 2 months there are no problems..Great performance with superb battery backup..I recommended this is you have low budget under 10000... 
 The phone battery never goes down at any point. Very handy and smooth to use. The camera clarity is worth 6999 rupees."THIS PRODUCT IS WORTH FOR WHAT YOU PAY" 
 this is a good mobile and has its own style too
totally a good mobile :)
try providing it with a good flip cover 
 Really this is a good phone nice performance and good battery life .but the camera is bad the front camera is OK but the back camera is very bad. 
 This phone are sooooo good. Its weight are only 120 grams and this phone are very easy for gaming and its download speed are so good. Lenovo company are so well in laptop and mobile so i think when you want to buy any mobile first buy this phone and use it. 
 nice phone ,good feature ,nice dolby sounds system, HD display ,very much flash light ,many more is usually in this phone ,This phone is small budget in very nice feature available, but phone with not attached a handfree 
 Very good mobile in low cost. 
Camera is best for Photos and video also. 
Sound quality is the best.  
Front camera is also good for video chatting

 I am using this mobile from past 9 months. from past one month I am facing heating issue. remaining every thing is working good. and there is no hug problem in this product. 
 This seems to be a good phone @ the price mentioned.
 Light Weight.
 Good speed
-Camera 
Overall good 
 Thanks for excellent packing and delivery.
Really good product, worth every penny. Cool
I would sourly recommend this phone for anyone who is looking for a budget phone with almost all features. 
 Awesome phone, must go for it without any hesitation... I purchased this for my dad n he liked it so much. Great performance n output... 
 i have bought this phone from flipkart i wans a bit tensed about the phone being not to reach my expectations but it has not dissapointed me at all the phone is a superb hpone 2Gb ram makes it even more faster all i want to say about the phone is that dont hesitate taking it 
 initially we faced a trouble with the mobile and we asked for the replacement with the new but the flipkart rejected and suggested some settings over the phone. we are not happy with the product 
 Very nice look and speed, having cool finishing and very good camera, battery backup is also good, the phone is small heating while using with charge 
 I brought the phone last year and using it till now no problem with phone and I dropped the phone severally time ,the condition is too good . any looking for a smartphone go for it .. 
 It was a good product in the starting but after 9 to 10 days the phone starting being hot to the screen side when we talk for 2 to 3 min . The model is good if you use it more then our limit it will stuck then we should remove the battery and again keep it . But it is a good phone . 
 (GOOD PRODUCT FROM FLIPKART) 
 super product only thing is to that battery get warm up while browsing nd charging time apart frm this everything is nic 
 Awesome cheap and good lenovo A60000 plus.8mp camera is awesome.do not be afraid because this is good 
 This mobile is good and excellent battery backup and also worth full .i am using this mobile from three months till now there is no issue...... 
 it is the best phone a man can get. All features stuns this device and its a must buy.... i would more off give it a 10 stars 
 I like the Service .................................................................................................... 
 writing this review after 8 months of use. it is working absolutely fine. no heating, no hanging, good baterry life and working fine after l updated to 5.0.2 . some device may create problem after os update but after reset it will work fine. and yes it is a very light weight phone u wont feel like u r carrying a heavy thing in ur pocket. 
 One of the best phones in low range . Heating is a problem if you open several application simultaneously. 
 Good mobile processing very vastly with out any lags ,camera obsuletly perfect 
 It has some heating problem if we talk for 30 minutes.....except this its good. 
batter is exceptional........
Nice Buy 
 This phone is in budget,and super speed and i use roughly but this device can't hanging when use of multitasking, and lollipop upgradeable. RAM 2 GB and i use fully load of applications, after using of many app on my phone its available 1.3 GB of RAM.... battery like a 3000 mah on my roughly use....  
 Cheap mobile with ultimate features and super working condition after one year soo smart a mobile is fully considered as economy mobile great to be onwer of Lenovo a6000 with 2 gb ram and 16gm internal memory and many fanabtastic features .
 sooo good mobile 
 As usual excellent support and speedy delivery from flip-cart team .. wish you all the best . keep the good support . 
 It is looking so nice one.
there is very nice features also at this price you never got a brand new phone.
processing speed is so good. 
 1. I really miss the notification light.
2. The volume and power button are not fixed to the chassis of the phone rather to the back cover so its not as tactile as i needed it to be given that i cant wake my screen unless i press the power button. So thats kind of a downer. 
3. The facebook and messenger apps make all phones laggy but this phone is handling it like a beast. 
4. The last 10% takes a lot more time than expected.
5. The notification pull down does not reveal a transparent background but a gradient of blue and green, i really did not like this. 
6. The inbuilt tones are sad. I have to download tones for message notifications now. 
7. Its fast,
8. Auto brightness actually works, unlike so many other phones
9. The touch sensitive buttons are not back lit but they should have at least been brighter.
10. Pretty dope cameras as well.
11. Overall no qualms buying the phone despite my negative rant. lol 
BEST PHONE IN THE PRICE RANGE 
 Thank you. I got ny phone next day with nice packing. I will buy again 
 When I bought this it was working fine. After 1 month I had battery problem also mobile getting heated while making calls and while using WiFi. When told this to my friends they told they have same problem. So don't buy lenovo, battery is getting heated up to 45C. 
 It was the first purchase from delivery was before promise date.....
I'm using phone for 8 months....
not a single issue is faced by me....
I can say that its value for money... 
 Good Product nice features in budget price. But over heating for long duration calls. In on-line websites lenovo don't provide head phones but in shops Lenovo providing head phones also. 
 This is the worst mobile ever i seen.. After using of 3 to 4 months more problems r coming. when i tried to call some one it will not work nd heating tooo much ... But i senn gud thing in mobile is that it will not slow ,it will load heavy games also and battery backup also gud ... but the only problem is that dailer will not work in some times 
 at Rs.6900/- this is the best phone, only draw back is it gets heated when charging, when using 4G, speaking for more than 3 minutes 
 Reviewed after 4 month of use
1. Battery drains out fast. Require 2-3 charging per day. or else use battery saver mode to save some battery and buy some more time for recharge
2.exceptionally slow dialer. sometimes need to tap number 7-8 times before call get connected. many times it doesn't connect even. Its Irritating. 
3..Camera is OK. Gives good picture in light. Dark images in evening or lowlight.
4.Messaging hangs if you do a search in message.
5.No option to directly move images from phone to sd card.
6.Serious problems in contacts. contact present in contact list when searched would not show up. need to manually go to the location by scrolling.
7. Service center has common response to the dialer disfunction is water entry and damage due to fall !!!! :( 
Better to put some money and buy any other trusted brand.    
 I brought this mobile for my father.
He has been using this phone for past 3 weeks and I'm very glad that there are no problems till date.  
I searched a lot before narrow down to this phone at a price tag of Rs. 6711
A 2 GB RAM, 16GB ROM, Snapdragon 410 processor, 5" screen, 8 MP camera is the best deal. 
I guess many other things have been clarified before... 
But still for all those who gave 1-2 stars for them I want to clarify few things:
This phone comes with a lot of bloatware (including Google+) remove them before even you start using your phone, removing bloatware is a one time process and doesn't take more than 10 mins. 
Mobile devices are not gaming machine, very high gaming use will obviously drain down battery quicker. 
Personally I use stock android mobiles hence I don't like UI provided by any other companies (Lenovo Vibe UI, Xiomi, Samsung etc.) and this is the only problem I think in this mobile. But for all those who don't care about UI, this mobile is best.   
 Dear all never buy this mobile because I bought 30 days before now it take to charge the battery for a long time 6-7 hours and exhausted if you use or not within one or two hours. 
 Not bad.. Looking good..nice display front camera average...excellent processing...good primary camera.. 
 Best mobile 
Please confirm usb otg supported yes n no Lenovo team 
 What to say much about this phone as all r giving so good good compliment(take negative) in the same way i warned everyone dont for this mobile its hangs always and most funny part about this what i m facing nowadays is keypad is not working properly and so on.. 
 Lenovo A6000 plus was very heat to using calls and charge battery in mobile... Un use to childrens and call hearing of all humans 
 FORGET about all the negative reviews,
it is a fantastic piece, the battery last more than a day for a normal user
its performance is very fast. I guarantee that it is a good phone
Dont think, just buy it......:) 
 The phone gets heated too much and it is unbearable. If this quality had not been there, it would have been a very good phone. 
 This mobile not good. Continutionaly hanging & getting heat.After removing head phones and ear phone we need to set volume high then only we can listen calls ring tones. 
 I'm using this phone for around 20 days now and I'm not at all happy with its performance. Even though it has 2 GB RAM & 64-bit quad core processor multitasking is very painful 
 Fantastic product. Has been using it for 7mnths and I will have to admit that it is the best smartphone in the 6-7k INR price bracket. 
 It is a good product under Rs7000 but camera not so good as xiaomi prime 2 or like samsung phones,
sound quality also average, dolby effect is not good enough to listen,one sim slut is for 4g but the other slut is compatible with 2g only , whereas other phones like xiaomi have both 4g slut.. processing is fast with 2gb RAM size and shape of the phone is good slim ,low weight , good service from flip kart delivered in 8 days in good condition... 
 awesome mobile,best in class fully worth of money...
slim,battery bckup is great,camera is nice but little bt lack of details. 
 EXCELLENT PRODUCT I BUY 2 PHONES........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ 
 - after updating the android version 4.4 to 5.01 performance good with any bug  
+ve:Battery, performance 
-ve: Wifi strength 
 The seal of the box was sticker with fevicol and was having loose battery connection as well as calibration... 
 EVERY THING COOL, SOME DOUBT ABOUT CAMERA & SPEAKER..
AFTER FEW DAYS WRITE BRIEF REVIEW .. BATTERY NOT SO BAD..
GETTING LOLLIPOP UPDATE ..
RATING MAY BE INCREASE..
after my first day reviews I say this is a good product...more time spending with it..i suggest not go with it...Just I my first Karboon A12 plus bettER...i suggest dont go for it...I think Lenovo make some good lot product first time when launch the product..after that they ignore quALITY....
THANK U FLIPKART ,SOLVED THE ISSUE...  
 good phone for those who never used a smartphone . cheap plastics used but what lies inside is the crux which is an excellent processor and gud HD qulity screen . the screen size is bigger than expected . its a value for money phone 
 I bought Lenovo A 6000 plus through Flipkart . As expected the delivery is with in 2 days .
Have been using this phone for 1 month. 
Pros :
1) So fast with 2 GB ram 
2) Great sound with dolby speakers.
3) Camera is also nice.
4) Battery Back up is nice .
5) Wifi Hpt spot is great , i was able to work with Wifi Hot spot for continuous 8-10 hours for 2 days back to back , but did not fine any issue and even battery was also consumed very less.  
Cons:
1) Lenovo might have provided ear phones with this . We need to buy ear phones separately which a little expensive for good ear phones.  
 Nice mobile in price tag.but there is no earphones. camera performance also could be better. 
 Please buy Power Bank along with this phone Battery go down very quickly. Phone is very slow and hang a lot not a good phone to have it. 
 Not too good phone at this price problem with heating and hang after software updation in lolipop rest nice camera in front and rear with gaming sole 
 It was great shopping experience from flipcart surprisingly it came within two days after placing order. 
 Phone was nice but only problem is it's really getting heated while we r not even using it.... 
 AT ALL THANK YOU FLIPCART, FOR YOUR SERVICE. I ALWAYS TRUST YOU AND WANT TO SUPPORT YOU AND I AND MY FAMILY ARE TOTALLY IMPRESSED. HAPPY TO GET GOOD SERVICE THAN YOU 
 It was a nice experience with this phone. I was confuse before buying this phone, thinking what phone should I buy. This phone is the best in the specified price. All apps have good interface with a smart look. 
 Hai friends
 I bought this lenovo a6000 + on nov15 and got a replaced one on the same month for screen touch problem,thanks to the amazing customer res ponse for flipkart and the seller WS retail, 
After a 6 months usage,here is my review 
 Plus of the product 
 1)light weight
 2)front camera nice(just 2mp)
 3)touch response good
 4)4g connection on1st sim(not tested till now)
Negative of the product(this comes a lot)very disappiinted  
 1)the battery is average and breaked the expectations on it (comes to. Below 20% after 2 hours of internet use ) 
 2)the phone heats up lot like ironbox after moderate use
 3)they mentioned it is a Dolby enabled,but now I listened a third class audio output
 4)I didn't beware before buying this,it is a single sim 4g conn,not even 3g on 2sim
 5)when you open the back cover andchange the simcard,the battery decrease by15to20%
 6)Otg t supported
 7)rear camera was not exactly clear
 8)corning gorilla glass absent
 So please consider this and buy?????

 I had gifted this to my wife for last year birthday. Today I have purchased one more for me...Great mobile with great specs..and price.. 
 i placed the order for lenovo A6000 plus, i get a phone without headphone. please check and verify 
 phone is good except camera quality is avg.i used is since last 6 month & after update not facing any issue 
 Very good mobile at this price range. Camera quality is good and the body built is also good at this price. 
 Very nice Mobile and very slim camera clarity super i love this phone 
 Excellent phone in this price range. I updated to 5.0 lollipop. Now good backup..awesome speed..super camera all are too good... 
 recomended product.sure to watch out for. rear camera could have been better.although good product.flawless. 
 Phone Use is very nice a negative problem is flash light some time didn't work...
remaining is good*** 
 but front camera is not good as Lenovo A6000, plz improve if u can......................................... 
 brought it for one of my friend, she is finding it very nice, decent look, picture quality is nice, battery backup is also nice, internal memory could have been little more, else it very delicate and handy product.. can go for lenevo mobiles.. particularly this 1 is very good:) 
 firstly the graphic card is clocked at 310mhz eventhough its capabality is 400mhz otherwise do not update yr phn to lollipol 5.0.2 everything is a problem there and donot forget to get tempered glass installed other than everything is okay dokey i had heating issues but somehow solved it 
 got Lenovo A6000 Plus on time but package does not contain earphone in box..... this is disappointing.... thanks flipkart. 
 This phone is working perfectly .no issues till now found .good phone 
 Its working perfectly for the spent amount. Cant compare with the high end phones. I can suggest this phone for the people looking for a small budget phone with very good features. 
One issue I noticed is with memory card which contains a very large no of files (like images and songs) Phone is heating and battery is draining very fast in 2 hours. i solved this by un-mounting memory card when not in use. Other than this working fine. 
Special thanks for the very fast delivery of this product. 
 Good phone but if apps are more the battery starts draining.Its better to install clean master immediately after buying the phone.My phone was excess with apps and it started draining.This phone gets heated and battery starts getting down. Anyways very good phone having all the social networks and good sound and picture quality.Camera has many features.I recommend for all my dear friends.All The Best. 
 After lollipop update it works fast.  
Advantages:
1) 16 GB internal memory
2) Dolby Audio quality also best
3) light weight slim phone
4) Battery backup also superb
5) No heating 
 Camera quality is good. Battery backup also very good. I was able to watch two movies at a time. These much features with quality within such price is best deal..... Go for this 
 Very good mobile.
Worth it for Rs.7499. Using this for past 3 months no problem found. Happy to buy this product... 
 GOOD phone. but not included earphone . cemera is 8 mp if it have 13 mp the it is better then other. it have good rom & ram . it is good mkae your ilfe better . but it have one sim only 4g if it have both sim 4g+4g then more marketed.

 Really i am very happy to purchase this Moblie. Thank you for flipkart service. 
I purchase this one 6 months back... till now i am not getting any complaint... 
so ... it's really good. 
 I gifted it to my friend and he is greatly surprised after experiencing its specifications.thanks to flipkart and Lenovo for providing budget smartphone in such prices.I also got this mobile in offer times at 6699.the only worried thing is it's sar value so friends use wired head phones or earphones to avoid its radiation.otherwise it is great phone in its segment. 
 waste of buying it is not at all satisfactory working dull and slow occupies 1.7 gb space of RAM And voice clarity is also not clear 
 The mobile is excellent. 2 GB RAM super fast, internal memory 16 GB also very good, battery back is very good. I love flipkart for customer support. The seller is also very good. I am very much happy with shopping with flip kart
