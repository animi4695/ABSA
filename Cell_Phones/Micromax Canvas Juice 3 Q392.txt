Well I am not impressed. This product really a good piece of ******.  I liked it's all features but can't use/call for a long time.  Then it's started to show it's real character. It's battery temp will increase  and it will hang for min 10-15min.I had received  a diffective product.  I am going to return it.  Mobile is ok.  Touch sense is not good. In call volume is not good.smartphone is ok , but 7.6K is bit high price , for 9K almost double the features are available in MarketGood product faster deliveryGreat still no have issue only battery disappointed but as per the value it's a good handsetthis ia touch phone , it not  support  touch screen  sometimes  otherwise goodThis phone is having speaker problem and 3 months now, problem is not resolved.
