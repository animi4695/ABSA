 Panasonic P55 Novo, After Using Approx 1 Month Then i Share My review
# Phone Touch Is Very faster & Smooth
# Nice Battery Backup
# Very Sharp Quality in Both Camera 
 What more to expect from Panasonic??? Hats off to ur engineers for making such an awesome phone at this price. I am not fan of any particular brand but this brand is pulling me.... and i cannot stop myself. 
I have written so many reviews in my blog right from iPhone 6 Plus to Karbonn phones. So i want u ppl to get a genuine review. That's it.  
Let me introduce u this phone.......
.This is an advanced version of P55 called P55 NOVO. (big bro
) 
The specification u can read it from above mentioned and compare it to any phone. I am not doing that as every one does the same thing here. 
This is a review after using this phone for 2 weeks. 
First i will start with the Battery Backup as it is one of the most desirable feature in any smart phone. I have tested this battery from 100% to 2%, and this lasted for 1.5days with average usage.(( like 2 hrs games, mobile data(3G), WIFI(always on)) I think 2500mAH battery does a great job. It has also got over charging protection app. so ur battery is totally safe. 
Next come to screen. It has got vibrant screen with very good viewing angle. As it has got 277ppi in 5.3inch does a good job again. Text is very crisp and images are in true color.  
The camera quality is also very good. They have used 13 MP camera with flash. The images are natural. Front camera is 5MP with "FLASH". So "SELFIE" addicted ppl here comes a gr8 device for u.  
Next thing they have added in this phone is Peel Smart Remote. Which u might have seen in other high end devices like Samsung, HTC, LG.  
The build quality is also very good as they have used metal to wrap the phone. They have tried to make similar design as u have seen Samsung Alpha in all the four corners of the phone.  
Next come to weight. It is slightly heavy than any other phone in this range.  
It runs with Android 4.4.2 and no news for update to lollipop. 
This phone is gr8 to buy at this price. The size of this phone is also very good as it perfectly fit in hand.  
There is no heating issue in this phone. As in smart phone heating is normal. But after a heavy usage the phone slightly warms up. SAAR value is also much lower. 
There is no 4G(LTE) in this phone.  
Overall if u want to buy under 10000rs then this is one of the best choice.  
Thumbs up for Screen, Camera and Built quality. Looks like a premium phone.   
 I bought this from a retail store of trivandrum by paying Rs9000/on24/07/2015.For the first 5 days the battery backup was below average it hardly lasted 1day,now battery backup increased by half a day more.p55novo has a 5.3 inch IPS display with moderate viewing pleasure,screen is big but hand friendlyPros; big enough for viewing,IR blaster for controlling tv,dvd bluray player etc,robust build except back cover,13 mp rear&5 mp front cameras with triple flash&single flash,attached flip cover,native video calling facility,(video calling can be done with out skype or such sevice providers),very good earphone.Cons;below average multimedia sound,no stereo speakers. 
 Best,affordable premium phone...High lights are 13 mp camera with triple led flash,5 mp front cam with flash,IR,octacore processor..... 
 Good performance and good battery life and good camera. Front camera also performance Very good. But in low light the cameras become very dull 
 Phone is very awsm ...just love panasonic ...i think everyone should by this
Its an affordable phone . just loved it guyzz ! 
 camera in not good,when capture photo after its convert in very dark image 
why its happening i m looking to go service center 
 Itz a great phone. 
Camera is average but good for the price. 
Call quality very good. 
Headphones super. 
Speakers OK
Screen great
Battery Good
No lag
No heating 
Over all bang on for the bucks. 
 its camera resolution an clarity is awesome.........
with 5mp front cam with flash and 13 mp back with triple led
can be updated to lollipop version...
but gets heat after sometime of usage 
 This mobile phone looks great from both sides, this product have both nice cameras, they'll provide nice camera quality even in low light conditions, and this phones battery backup is very good, no leg problem when you switch between multiple apps at a same time. So from my opinion you must but this phone if you want to purchase a mobile phone between 7-10k. 
 Good mobile in 6500/-range, but battery should be 3000mah capacity for Android mobiles. If you not using mobile also it is consuming battery. To avoid consuming charging use power battery app. Mobile is over all good except battery.battery is not good and not bad.I suggest to the people who are interested to buy mobiles in range 5-10k 
 Good product... Very easy to handle.
Good options.. Sounds good. 
 Very good product with great prize. I order 2 phone and that work fine till now 
 I am happy with p55 novo. Battery backup is fine. Camera is ok. I am using this from last 6 months and it is st 
 Its an awesome phone.compared to samsung It does not hang.good camera quality best phone and affordable too??? 
 Gr8 phone ...... Must buy.... Great camera quality... Nice battery backup  
 Amazing picture quality, Remote option is very usefull, front cam n flash r awesome best wishesh flipcart 
 Very nice phone. Good performance. Good camera quality. Good Clarity at low lights. 
 I have purchased this 2 weeks back and I got my mobile 3 days advance than expected delivery date. This product is good. No hanging and camera also 13 Mp. 
Thanks for providing screen guard and cover. 
 NICE PHONE TO BUY,
FEATURES ARE VERY GOOD AND LESS COST .CAMERA QUALITY IS VERY GOOD.I SUGESTED TO BUY   
 Awesome phone, package was neat and clean, delivery was before estimated time. 
havent used phone much but till now working great 
 It's a very good phone ..
I got flipcover as well as screen guard & Headphone, usb along with this phone.
But camera quality is VERY BAD..  
 this is a avg mobile, 
it has 13 mp camera but quality is like 5 mp,
it has triple led flash but it never compitite with single led flash mobile - ex-samsung j5. 
low touch sensitive compare with other branded devices ex-galaxy s duos. 
songs hearing quality in headphones worst, if you music lover dont buy this mobile.  
if u travel one place to another place it consumes more battery 100% charg wiil vanish with in one hour. 
but mobile out look design is nice. 
 I bought this phone last month, 
Disappointed for its battery, when I'm using internet and WiFi on it, its battery getting down immediately. please give its replacement with new phone. 
 the phone p55 novo just a jewel by panasonic....
1) the battery back up is brilliant ....i used almost a full extent for a day, after that it has 44% charge left.
2) No lags will multi tasking
3)Front and rare both cameras are awesome in this range. i clicked a photo in 0% visibility darkness and it got all the details very accurately.
4) the display is as like as IPS
5) But the speaker is little bit low.....Head phone sound is good  
Finally in this price range it is total paise vasuuul phone. 
 Got the blue one today. It looks sexy and premium . Bit tough to operate with one hand. Camera is very average but selfie with flash gives an advantage. 450 MB ram free after 1st boot which enables me to multitask . I am not a huge gamer so cant tell the gaming exp but played tample run and subway surfers which did run flawlessly . Battery is performing like 2000 mAH though it has 2500 mAh . Will let you know after 7 days of huge uses . You can go for it if you want to show of a craftsmanship and basic day to day operation.. You will fall in love... 
 in specification it shows 13mp camera, but after use i realized that it is not work as 13mp very bad quality camera..... 
bad display quality \
video play very bad 
 its a totally Waste of Money. Battery Back up is only 5 hours when I am fully Charging My phone. Overall when I use net for 1 hours continue, its automatically Heat up start behind phone. Overall I suggest to all please don't bought this phone. Its a bad phone 
 Panasonic phone is bad phone 1 gb ram hung phone is battery 2 hours no clerty oh no bad phone Panasonict 
 Fully fed up with flipkart service and this phone.
I ordered for this phone on 5th may and got it on 6th may. I am facing problem of Over heating once the costumer care executives told that it is not under our conditions to replace or refund. and on other hand another executive told me that they will send some technician to check it out and will replace or refund if any problem will be found. i launched a complaint on 2-3 june and till today(13-06-2016) not found any technician. and without any knowledge of me send sent an replacement order for me and i had never asked for it. I got a call from the delivery boy he asked to come and collect this parcel nearby my home. and there he said that it is not a replacement order. What the hell is this i had never ordered any mobile again i am facing so much issues with this phone. on Clean Master it is 60 degrees temp of CPU. Unable to answer a call with this temperature. Totally fed up with flipkart service and this panasonic phone.
after this all i rejected this phone and got a call from technician that he is here for the lookup for my phone i was out of my home so told him to visit me some other day. Now i dont want any replacement and will not use this flipkart again. Totally fed up with flipkart i wont recommend flipkart to anyone.. This was my last purchase here.
good bye flipkart 
 Less battery backup and worst quality camera, even touch screen also sometimes not working.I have asked for replacement but they gave some gyan. 
 I have given my panasonic P55 mobile in service center at Vinayak Enterprises, Karol Bagh, Delhi on 03-03-2016 for the repair due to charging problem. They said to me that there is a problem in mother board of the mobile hand set so it will send to the company in Mumbai and it will get repaired within 20-25 days maximum within 30 days, but till date my mobile is not got repaired and given back to me as now its almost 2 and half month has gone. As and when I called to service centre and customer care centre they always give me 10 days time to wait since last one month and till date not given me any satisfied reply nor given me proper status of my mobile. there is no any updated status is available in r/o my mobile I agree with Pooja Kohli - ----Worst Mobile----Panasonic. Zero customer support....Selling mobiles like vegetables. Sometime your vegetable vendor will listen to you and help you but in case of Panasonic....its totally waste of money. I recommend that no one buy any mobile of panasonic. 
 i got a damaged product ...................................................................which have softare prblm ... 
 this phone is very good ;camra flash lite all is good video quality awesome ii am brought this product again but this is out of stoke thank you very much flipkart 
 I purchased a P55 Novo two days back. I set the wake up alarm to 0630 hrs., switched it off & went to sleep. The alarm didn't sound. Same for today morning. I tried various timings but always got the same result. 
Today a Customer Care fellow at their Mobile Toll free told me NO PANASONIC MOBILE HAS WAKE UP ALARM FACILITY! 
Kudos to PANASONIC for returning us to the Stone Age! 
As icing on the cake, nobody attends their Gurgaon HO no. 124-4751300. 
 It takes months to get handset repaired as it is send to Gurgao or head office for major repairs under warranty and then they refuse warranty without informing customer.  
 THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD.IT'S DESIGN IS ALSO VERY GOOD.BUT IT'S TOUCH MODE IS VERY SLOW.I AM NOT SATISFIED WITH IT'S TOUCH MODE. 
 A third class phone hanging problem and bad battery back up phone is not good 
 I have purchased this phone through Flipkart from seller " icetreecollection" and received a used, damaged phone. I have received this phone in an old box and seals were broken. Please don't buy from this seller any product. I am not the first person facing this issue. Please go through the user review about the seller. 
 super prdt. value of money 
 Panasonic P55 Novo mobile is not as per specification as well as got hanged usually. Mobile operates automatically & we have to save our contact details 2/3 times in contact book. 
As well as do not purchase this product through Flipkart, they are not obey their commitment. 
 I was not very sure about the product while buying but after using it for a month i can say its a great product, its a great choice if you are budget conscious,the only problem is audio is quite low. 
 why dot you mention navigation Features??
its support G gps-google maps??.

 I bought a Panasonic Eluga S mini smartphone with IMEI number 359570060218137 three months before. After two months of buying the handset has got some vertical lines on the display. Then I submitted the phone in the Panasonic service center. More than one months have passed, I still didn't got my phone back. When I contact to Panasonic customer service they only say, 'Sir server is low can you call us after two hours then We can say the status of your phone'. And the members of service center are saying that only Nokia and Samsung can deliver phones instantly. Then why buy panasonic??
