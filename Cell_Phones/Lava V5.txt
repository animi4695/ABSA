If you are looking for a phone in this price bracket, go for Lava V5- it has great camera, good looks, 4G, 3GB Ram, promised Android M update! 
Recommend it to all! 
 The camera is suupperrrbbbb man. Rear and front both click amazing shots even in poor lighting and it has additional software features for making your images look better.. 
I have tried wide selfie with my gang of girls and they came out well.. 
I even created GIF other day and that was also cool... 
Thanks Lava for giving me so many features in budget price... 
 It's light in weight, nice camera and feature as well...battery also seems conviencing to me. 
Overall I've not faced any issue except.. 1 ) minor heating issues 2) screen guard is of very poor quality
3) I can't add 2 number of a single person under same name.. 
 Nice Camera result

all are good 
but some time its hit the phone

if u have fixed budget then buy it  
otherwise go for moto x 
 My roommate bought Lava V5 recently and its an awesome phone. He has been using this phone since a month and till now he has not faced any problem. In fact, the performance of the phone is superb. Here are few of the features why I think its worth the money invested
 13 MP primary camera with super fast auto focus
 8 MP front camera that takes awesome selfies
 3000 mAh battery life
 Sleek and stylish design
 4G enabled
 3GB RAM which makes it a fantastic phone
 Lastly priced affordably.  
 Immediately after Lava launched it Lava V5, begged my uncle to buy this phone as it has some amazing features that was worth its price---definitely the best compared to other phones at this range. Has quad-core and 3GB RAM the phone that runs so smoothly without any problem of hanging even as you play games and run multiple apps simultaneously. The option to upgrade the Android Lollipop 5.1 to Marshmallow is great for users as they can change it at their will. And as the phone is known for its camera, let me tell you that its 13MP primary camera that does not disappoint you to capture moments in split seconds. Need I mention about their 8 MP for selfie? If you want to go for a phone that performs as its price demands, then this is it. 
 Lava V5 looks like an amazing phone. I read about its specs and saw the reviews on forum sites and considering what Ive read I think Ill give this a try too. Looks good with metal finish body and curved edges for better grip plus the additional other features makes it a budget phone! 4G enabled, powered by a 3000 mAh battery and 16GB internal storage, its a dream. Icing on the cake is its 13MP rear and 8MP front camera. Looking forward to getting one for myself! 
 My friend suggested the Lava V5 after using it for a month since he has never had any issues with it yet. The phone runs smooth and I dont recall him saying that its sluggish or hanging ever. The 13 MP rear and the 5 MP front cameras perform well and make casual photography a joy. I admit that Im also a bit tempted to buy this phone for myself as well. 
 Camera is good ram is also perfect front camera is low quality in night battery is better 
 super mobile i like very much warth mobile for this cost .............  
 Nice Camera Phone Battery Back up also good 3 GBram awesome. 
 good design slim model
light weight
camera not good as expected from 13mp cam
front camera flash is just for formality again not a good cam as calmed for 8mp 
battery is draining fast
i bought this mobile for just 1 purpose camera dedicated mobile under 15k
before this i used asus zenfone 6 selfie,its a class mobile on all regards.
so far dont feel anything great about lava V5 i think i made a bad choice. 
 Excellent device...................no lag in the performance...........it's just fabulous............. 
 super mobile
light weight
camer quality is good
never struck
battery back is very good  
 Bought this Lava V5 and bit satisfied with the features and the price. I am really happy using it's camera. Moat powerful feature is with it's function of Camera. The speaker quality is also good. Touch is simply superb with it's wonderful slim size. Thanx Lava 
 Buy this product one week back and the performance is very nice. Smooth touch experiences. Nice display, good bettery life and overall a very crispy clear camera with lots of new features. 
 My mom used to have a Micromax canvas phone, but she wasnt happy with it, especially the camera. So, on her bday, I gifted her Lava V5 and now she is always using her phone and never has once complained about it. This phone has an amazing camera and charges at a great speed. Apart from that, its icy white colour makes it sleek and beautiful. I just had to pay 11K for this awesome smartphone. 
 I used to have a Nokia 215 which I had been using for a couple of years. The best decision that I made was to switch to Lava V5. My new phone is so much better than my previous phone, I mean theres no comparison. The main thing that I wanted my phone to have, was the camera and Lava V5s camera is TOO GOOD. Apart from that, it has a fast and smooth touch and its battery charges in just a couple of hours. I just paid 11k and got a beautifully designed sleek smartphone that works best for me. 
 On paper the specs of Lava V5 impresses me with the 5.5 inches HD display, Quad Core Processor powered by 3GB of RAM also the Android Lollipop (with guaranteed upgrade) gets my thumbs up! For me its the battery that matters the most and it more than fulfills that criteria with the 3000 mAh. Look wise its not too bad on the eyes either and because of these precise reasons Ive already placed the order for one! 
 Got Lava V5 last month and have been using it since thenand havent faced any issue with it so far! Even the 4G thing is also working fine, just that initially I had faced a lil bit of issue with the consistency of the network, its only after that I got it checked by my network that it started functioning smoothly!

 Great quality rear and front camera
 Dual SIM phone
 Long lasting battery

 The item has been out of stock since long time.
Had been waiting for this to come up so eagerly.
hard to believe that there are new ads coming on TV whereas the model has been out of stock for more than a month time ! 
 front camera is not clear. its show image like vga camera. too much noise on screen while capture image in low light. 
 I want this phone ???????? plz plz notify me when it comes in stock... am eagerly waiting for it..... 
 After using this phone for 5 days my experience; 
V5 is very good at this great price. It has some good as well as bad things.
Touch is very smooth, liked it.
Very slim handset. 
Motion gesture, smart wake up features are great.
RAM is best. Total 63 apps installed, using them still 2000 mb RAM is free.
Processor is quite good. 
 Mobile hangs little sometimes.
Camera phone? 13 mega pixel camera quality is very insulting for its name as a Camera phone. Front camera, 8 MP is of worst quality. Its images looks like taken from 2 or 3 MP camera.
Flash? Dual LED flash is useless, its just dual and work as half. Front flash is useless. No camera features.  
******Better go for Lenovo A7000. Low price, good processor, better camera than Lava V5.***** 
""GPS NEVER WORKED, EVEN ON 4G.""
**""Play store not working. Says BACKGROUND DATA disabled but its not disabled.""**
"""""BATTERY DRAINS QUICKLY."""" 
Heating is more than normal. Heats up quickly while playing apps and during charging. 
### Speaker volume is low. Headsets sound is very poor, very poor bass effect on lava & Phillips headsets.####
Calling volume is very low, you have to press hard ur mobile on ur ears to listen. 
Battery cover clip points breaks while removing & attaching cover. 
I'm going to return it.... 
 does it supports front flash or not .........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
