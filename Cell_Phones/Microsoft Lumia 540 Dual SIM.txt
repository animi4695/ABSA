 This is awesome phone .... very cheap and very brilliant
amazing speed
the best phone and the best os ever better than andriod and ios 
 but y flipkart is selling tis mobile in above 10k i dont know b'coz microsoft sellin tis @10199 flipkart may reduce tis price 
 good handset with a interesting Operation system..and camera is aswammm.. Ram is only 1GB..But that also enough for windows better than Android.. Where lumia 540 holds only 2200 mAh bettary..But it is equal to 4200 mAh bettary in Android set...... 
 awesome some in this range. 
you must buy this phone.
i like its touch is faster than android.
in blue color it is sexy phone 
 Long story Short. FULLY SATISFIED u guys. Just go for it. Bang for Bucks. Faced no problems what soever. 
I must admit i'm obsessed with Microsoft's Design. both looks of the phone itself and the OS .Windows phone 8.1 Denim is really smooth . Beautifully designed unlike android or I OS designs which i personally don't like. Lumia also comes in various colours like this one LUmia 540 i got is Cyan colour. 
People often say they face difficulties in Windows phone since yes it does nt support some Appa. But believe me it has some some alternative apps which are better and Internet Explorer is more than enough for surfing the Web. I couldnt download Chrome but i could definatly download UC browser ., I also downloaded wp torrent , which we can use for downloading films softwares anything .
TO CONCLuDe: PLease dont worry about WIndos phone and BUy this baby.And Windows 10 mobile is almost here i'm excited to use that. 
 worst phone ever you see... its store is not working it shows a wired message of not working about it... you cannot download any apps as you need because the main thing store is not working.. if i cant get apps then why the shit i should pay 10000 for it i would go for some cheap phone.... !!!!!! 
 This is third class phone has heating issues and has no best graphic user interface I purchased it to be happy but Neither I am happy nor I am satisfied with this product Microsoft has no such applications.
1.Which android market has like youtube,truecaller and many more 
2.No call recording, most important feature which we want in today`s life 
3.Bad camera
4.Heating and Heating issues
5.We will have problem in phone book because its people application has no best gui. 
 The phone looks good and feels solid but the sound quality both for music and voice call is of poor quality. Video quality is not up to the mark. 
 Never take any lumia phone..its worst in the market...use krke preshaan hua..aaakhir me android lema hi pda..uske bina kaam nhi chlta...lumia series ekdm bakwaas h 
 i thought i recieved a good product from microsoft..and guess i was wrong. It was about 25days i used my phone...updated win10 and now it is in service center.. Intially they said software sucked and have to reinstall the s/w.. 2days later..they said flash port doesn't support..have to wait for the suite to check..waited for another 2days...and now they said you have to change completely...seriously i was so good to use windows10 but now fed up with my device.. i dont know flipkart is selling defected product or the microsoft! 
 Lumia 540 is Superb......
its camera is amazing........no words to say........... fantastic.......
the only problem is it is not 4G.. 
 Gifted to Dad, he took it while travelling, all of a sudden when he is back, said, SIM was not detected, surprisingly when checked the SIM in other handset, it was working fine, whenever expected such a product. 
Expected a call back from customer case, but in vain 
 i want samsung galaxy on7,This phone is very smart look and easy to use,So i exchange my microsoft lumia540,please you can to do,  
 just seller delivered item to me on 9th nov 2015 ..and it was stopped working (it might have softwear problem ) on 12th nov  
before you have purchase any item think about it 
 I have ordered the phone on dt 15.10.2015 and received on 19.10.2015. i am happy the fast delivery than the expecting date. The phone looks nice and attractive. Its Camera is just good not best (primary camera is 8mp & front 5mp). according to its camera samsung camera is best in 8mp & 5mp. Video calling is not available in facebook & messenger. Because the version used by this phone is old (Facebook version) and it can't be update because update version is not available for windows 8.1. Some other facilities is awesome in this phone. This is my first windows phone. But Android phone is better than windows phone.  
After 1 day of my use, i want to return the mobile due to some software problem but flipkart did not take it back. "They told me that you have to go to the microsoft service center, if they told us the mobile is damaged then we can replace/ refund against this, unless we can't do any thing for you." It is a very bad service of Flipkart to its customer. One thing i can't understand that why i am going to the service center and if he told them the mobile damaged then flipkart refund my money. Is it possible. I purchased the phone from flipkart not from Microsoft, Why flipkart did not take any solution.  
So friends i am requesting you did not buy any thing from flipkart & Microsoft. 
 the product ordered is still not delivered. there is not option to call any customer care number. order is just been moved all around Bangalore.. still unable to understand why. there is no cancel option 
Below is the way the order is moved around Bangalore for last 5 to 6 days. deliver date is missed.. and still no clue when it would be delivered.

 I purchased microsoft lumia 540 from flipkart, and my experience with this transaction with flipkart was really bad. First of all delivery was made very late compared to other shopping sites. Secondly packing of mobile phone was really very bad. Flipkart must at least maintain that much standard that if a order of 8500 is placed the packing must have to be at least satisfactory. 
 Pls any one tel can v keep ringtone ? ...........................................................................
