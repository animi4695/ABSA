I Donno clearly what to say...the mobile is good fr it's cost...There's this overheating problem....and this one made especially for its battery capacity is not so good for me...maybe I got a used piece or so...but the battery drains as fast as a normal mobile..So, my opinion is you can buy this mobile If u want a stylish easy operating one....If u r deep user of anroid,like rooting,plz dont buy...low internal space...amd u cant move apps to sd card!but don't trust online shopping fr electronicsdamaged in weak dont buy this produce because no replace on the same.Its ok or so so with the product Micromax Canvas juice 2, only one problem I have faced three times is that it tends to get, kind of hang & every other  options stops working at that time after a long time of such situation it automatically switches off after a while it again automatically switches on. You can not not predict that how long it will take to restore when such problem occur beside this it is working alright.its been two months, battery got damaged three times ...still fighting for replacement of the battery, i have already paid one time for battery replacment not its third time when again service center asking for battery replacment cost.The product is best at price  below 6200 rs .2gb ram is way too useful.charging batery shows red led notification .green shows 90% above charged. When plugged in.green lights blinking says there s a miss cl or msg.blue light blinking says there s a msg online...camera quality is awsome for back and reasonably good at front too.flash light s there at back.charge remains  for two days or more.i have been using this phone for 1 month...micro sim and unreplacable  batery are the only cons u woud find.those complaining on batery may have overused ur phone or received faulty piece i think.hope it never occur to me.so far the best.thank god for this.bought for father mother and me ...sugested for friends too....dont frget to switch of wifi....as at no range the symbol may be confused with wifi off....so make it a point to switch off wifi after use...big screen is good and plays all type of video....i also suggest to turn off updates of phone,playstore, unless a app stops to run if not updated.u can individually update such apps if unavoidable.,stop and disable  phone or software update in task manager to stop annoying add in notificatn bar....and dont dumb ur phone with all kind of trash apps to 'juice' 2 gb ram...as it just migh be. Following these would gaurentee trouble free working .worked best for three pieces purchased..will purchase again for friends when price goes  down .Awesome mobile , i ordered it through Amazon and received the mobile next days (within 16 hrs) , .Mobile is awesome . fast processing , clear resolution , HD videos quality is good . All on all its value for money  as of now , at approx 6000 cost you are getting 2 GB RAM and latest android version with awesome size and Brand .Go for it .I am editing my post now , as previous post i posted on 9 th NOV15 and today is 7th March16 , Still this mobile is working as its brand new , Never got hanged , its best in this price as of now , froont camera and daylight is very clear and better then other mobile ranging till 10k .This phone is always creating problem. Whenever we use for long time it's screen washout, within a month I have to take this mobile to service centre. So I am disappointed after buying this phone.First of all my bad experience started from delivery itself. Amazon delivered it through fed ex courier ( which i think is most unprofessional ) . After around 10 days of order when I did not receive my mobile I took intiative to track my courier but the contact number provided in fedex of chandigarh sector 23 branch , no one picked the phone after even trying for around 12-15 times. When I visited the branch I came to notice that phone kept on ringing but the person sitting there wishfully was not picking the  phone ( just like typical govt office). Anyhow when I asked for my courier I was shocked to know that due to lock at my house the courier was being returned that day, which is not true because there is always somebody available at my home. And also  courier comapany did not bother to call me even once and neither any message. And the courier person was also admitting their fault that they attempted just once for the delivery. Very very poor courier service and that too in city like chandigarh.  Any ways somehow I managed to get my phone. The  mobile i.e. juice 2 was not at all of good quality though lookwise it is goog but it is bit heavy , not comfortable for regular use. here i am writing my issues one by one below:-1)  very long battery charging time2)  poor battery backup3)  Auto rotate function stopped working after 1 day of use4)  in 3 days of use  it hanged around 10-12 times. as battery is fixed we can't even restart it by removing battery.5)  poor touch response. have to hit hard back button to go back6)  weight slightly bulkyi returned the phone to amazon and without any hassal I got my money refund.  Service on Amazon part is satisfactory, but courier and mobile unsatisfactory. earlier i am using nokia limia 520 which i think is a master peice of nokia.if you are looking for phone i which you can watch videos, please do not buy this phone. all the videos were pixillated which could be viewed clearly in my old phone which was of also 6000 rs.the other features are nice, so if you are not interested in viewing clear videos then you can buy this.Product is good and as expected but delay in courier hurts, as I wanted it before dhanteras but that didn't happen, and for the name of compensation 100 rs gift card is been issued.Nevertheless the Phone quality is very good and if any one wants can go for it without any hesitation.A nice mobile phone along with being Indian by marketing or manufacture. It is worth the money.Money Vs. Performance - great  phone. I will recommend it for basic Users. This is good for people who have some limited usage. This is where long battery life comes into picture.As i said not going in detail for the specifications. Anyone looking @ RAM 2 GB + Strong Battery life + Budget -- > This is the phone.wow...super......the phone look is very grant.... very nice to handle....worth of money.......it's hangs a lot of time, it will stop responding and when incoming call the sensor will not work well, due to this the Hold button will be active resulting not able to hear.i liked this mobile and the specifications were amazing but after 10-15 days phone started hanging and i applied for return.thanks to amazon for such amazing return policy.i easily returned this product without any hassles and my money was refunded within a day as commited by amazon.Phone often turn white and do not respond. Need to wait until it is rebooted sometimes minutes sometimes in hours. Can be forced reboot by removing the battery though I will not always pull out my battery to do this. Waste of money. Looks good in the pic but on hand it is ok ok product only.as per feature , i would get 8 gb space and 2 gb ram but there is dfifeance as per given frature as it didnt get 8 gb space and 2 gb ram , there is only 4 gb internal memory and rest all infromations are fake .........pls don't trust on micromax  ....it was very bad experiance ........Many applications do not work. It is very slow. You can not even open facebook on your phone. I tried opening HDFC mobile banking and many other apps which not at all opening and always shows the message 'not responding'. sometimes blank screen comes and you can't do anything on phoneLook is good of phone but it is getting heated too fast and display is NOT great.DON'T ever buy this phone.....It's really Bakwas phone and always hanging.Screen washes out in the middle & you become helpless as you can't even shutdown it .You just have to wait and watch when will it start.It has got the most faltu camera. Useless.If you are thinking to buy this phone then better try any smart phone which is costing you around 900 Rs. At least it might give u the pleasure of using one cheapest phone.can't give even a quarter star..I have got a defective piece ; The response from the Amazon transporter was a real worse experience. It was a total irresponsible and illiterate behavior ; It totally damage the Amazon Brand image from my mind.Nightmare. Absolute 2 the last letter of it.Screen darkens at lowest brightness level. Keypad hangs every now and then.The phone looks killer though. This is a piece of garbage wrapped n a velvet cloth.Overheating is a major cause of worry..over that having 2 gb ram multitasking doesnt happn as fast as mentioned. B8t overall in al low budget a good phone for a person who is not bothered much on multitaskingI got my phone today MICROMAX CANVAS JUICE 2 I liked its looks and i got free screen guard and handsfree with the handset and charger in the box.. Today is the frst day and i hope it goes well for me always 'worst mobile ever.Heating issue,hangs up so frequent.the biggest issue is with touch pad..A total crap .only the good part about this mobile is battery bcz u don't get chance to use this for other purposes..smart work and beautiful look this mobile so I like it.Very bad no response from costmer care after purchasinggreat phone.. smooth and fast touch.. camera quality is good, battary backup exxcelent, some heating when charging and data connection on. overall very good phone this price from micromax. thanks to amazon.Please don't buy this phone!! It has lot of issues and I had to return it. I used the Hdfc bank EMI option and the s*** bank charged me twice. Amazon sells damaged items. Never expected this from Amazon!!!Most useless phone I have ever used. Stopped working after 3months of purchase. Had to repair it multiple times. Gets heated up very fast. Chargers only when the phone is switched off. Can't answer calls.Worst mobile after it delivered from Amazon.  I found display not working properly on same day.  Requested Amazon  to return my money backDon't believe Chinese mobile... No guarantee no warranty :-(Bad phone always hang. Screen goes white all the time.I have just got mobile on 30th OCT -2015 , just after one and half month my mobile got switched off itself , when I have opened back cover , I have found battery in total melt condition. What to do now?Its not a good phone...about storage this phone automatically stores data only in phone memory not in SD card..we can not change its default memory from phone to SD card and the sound is also very poor.Its almost after 50 days after purchasing I am writing this review.Just after using it on around 20 days I got problem of screen blackout. The screen is getting blacked out frequently and there is no way to make it in normal sate  as it was not getting restarted as well.When I contacted Amazon to return it. They denied it saying that mobile phones can be returned on and before 10 days after purchasing and since I am returning it later on 20th day.BUT  amazon customer service guys suggested me to meet Micromax service center for same. When I contacted Micromax service center they able to solve this problem by reinstalling some software.Now it is in working state but I always fear that screen blackout problem can hit anytime.It is very worst model, it reboot's automatically while i am playing games or browsing in net, no games working on it ,I gave my mobile to the micromax service center but the didn't care about itAmazing phone..Better than my previous Samsung Galaxy S4. This one never hangs, no matter how many apps i open.fantastic battery back up.. BUT just a bit heavy..Recommended.. :)This phone is too bad.Worse camera.After fully discharged it get 12 hrs to full charge.Battery backup is not good.Files above 500 mb cant copy from laptop into phone memory.Buy yuphoria instead of thisI gave this phone as gift for my WOW that denotes My MOM.She said rate it 5stars.At first I Can't understand.Then I got it what she said .She says to me indirectly that she likes the phone.J.K.Good option...in the price bracket. But you should mention (in the specification page) that it has fixed battery, which I didn't notice during shopping. Otherwise good packing and effective delivery.It's a old model I really hate this type of Cheatingplease dont buy this mobile under any conditions,if we play games for 10min it gets blank screen, and we cannot do anything untill it comes automatically,more defectes,camera not working correctlyIts very bad bad product plese don bye this productVery nice phone as per budget...Satisfied !!!First of all i would like to say that i bought this phone at 5500/- lowest price on than any other. Deleivery done on next day. Condition recieved excellent packaging. I opened the package and everything was included. Now this is my 3rd day and its running flawlessly.I have downloaded all the chat apps games running smothly.Guys believe me no company can give such a poweful phone under 6000/-amazon ia cheapest than all.Ram is 2gb excellentProcessor bestCamera and sound quality awesomeLollipop great looks and features.Multilanguage supportI will rate 1000/100 for this phone and of course amazon.Kudos to micromax team for this affordable phone.The battery drains very fast, cannot make even a single call. have to give to service center coz it have a non removable battery. I suggest buyers to avoid buying phones with built in battery.If you want to by a camer less smartphone, so you can buy this. The phone has actually on camera, if they claim there is a 8mp camera, you find the wrost camera made by man for ever.Heavy phone, camera quality is strictly OK. Not at all user friendly, though its android but functions are super complicated.I don't suggest for this phone. Go for Eureka or MIKeyboard tuch not working properSo much slowTOTALLY BAKWAS........... DONT PURCHASE THIS PHONEHeating problem.Better look for another brandPhone is weighing heavier than expected. Pixels/inch is also lower than other mobiles with this price range. Battery backup is good. Overall product is worth only for 3 starsWhat's wrong with this phone the board of this phone is spoiled.loudspeaker is also spoiled.please give me a suggestion where to give it for repair or else replace my mobile.Ultimate Phone i have purchase in the range of 6000/-.....All feature no hang bang, no heating problem...... internet going on full swing & no app working problem...........Hanging of device started from 1st week of purchase.Since purchase(4months ago) it hanged 5 times.. it occurs when device get over heated( 2-3 hours of continuos use)Internal memory is shown in adv. Is 8 gb but only 4 gb is availbale .. looks of the phone are also not good as it must be.. but good camera, good battery, good resolution..Most hated features -1. Too heavy2. Very complicated3. Performance is pathetic4. Camera quality is badIt's really awesome.. I loved it ! I presented to my father in law, he's using friendly & working perfectly well.. Thanks Amazon.. as the same services looking forward : )I have written like as given above for 1 months, after the month speakers not working, & I am roaming to service center.. still not working.. very badr u sure only hanging pblm not more . so wanna this mobile yr.. weekly one or two time hang ! chalta h yr jyada ho to pblm hota h ... thanks "abd amazon customer".Within a few days of the purchase, it stopped charging.  Bad choice. Touch buttons at the bottom hang sometimes. Charging jack got broken in a month. Don't buy this phone.I am using canvas juice and its an awesome piece in budget cost, specially in last long battery backup ,  but they (Micromax) came with next version of juice but i dont like to buy after reading some negative comments regarding the handset performance ,,,,but so far Micromax is an best company for those who prefer under budget but yet they have to improve various bugs like lagging, need to improve the quality of hardware,  hopes in future they will come up with better technologyWorst phone I used in my life. Phone doesn't display incoming calls. No way to accept calls. Heats up very quickly. Shouldn't have purchased this phone.Received mobile with damaged camera...This phone working on 4g...plzzz tell?Good lookingBest performanceback case is easily scratcableSo it need a back coverAll are asking to me  ' is it HTC  '???Good phone for the cost you pay and as in all micromax phones camera is not up to the mark however its ok. Other features and battery back up is goodmicromax canvas juice 2 is awesome phone battery good processor good and 2 ram so good no hang problem today is my 4 day so all of you buy this phoneReceived the product without invoice.Waste of money...don't buy this..it hangedup during its first game only..but thanks to Amazon it refunded my money.Absolute useless product from micromax.  I have returned it because of third class quality.  Thanks to Amazon for returning my money with in a day.Scrap product,never buy.Thave a charging problem with almost every set,so you should be lucky if you have not faced this issue with microns phone.Completely defective piece. Display goes on and off every few seconds. Touchscreen is also not working properly. Think twice before purchasing it.Very bad phone.Battery backup is very poor.After every 2 hour phone is automatic on/off.Overall, very bad quality of this phone.Very bad phone.........touch is the worst of this phone. can't  load games ......and hang....a  white screen appears in between of working!!!!!!!Just waste of money by buying this phone.... I bought it on 21 October kept it on charge for 5 hours but also the Mobil is not switching on......High Radiation mobile and iam not suggesting to any one. Pleaseeeeeeeeee Dont buy this. You can go with P55 Novo 2gb Ram & 16 Gb Internal Memory.Totally waste of money.I have used only 20 days & display is gone.Amazon sold the defective pieces.Never expect from Amazon...Hopeless  product. While  gaming  display goes blurred and I have to reboot.  Brightness level can't be adjusted.  Screen goes black. Don't buy.Phone is good for average user sometimes its more hazzy for active users......... Its display &  battery is good in its class price range......Few issues exists such as proximity sensor not working properly, camera quality not good as 8MP camera. etc Battery will satisfy expectations.RAM is good 2 GB.Battery stanby is good.Best value for the money.Touch is not so good.And camera is OK.Phone is little heavy weightWorst phone in market still complete one month.i phase display issue.if go to service center it take time more than one month to repalceits been only 1month i bought it and now i dont have any idea whts the problem its been shut down for latst 3days ...please do somethingAfter one month of use suddenly while using this phone gets heated and the battery becomes inoperative..Plz don't buy this phone.Bad charger....very slow charger....seems duplicate charger amazon should take action against it and stop to sell this kind of nonsenseThe battery of the phone purchased has worst performance and gone down. Not even had three months of life and I am harrashed for this.I got the best price here. But the most important thing is micromax is an Indian company. So go with micromax , go with make in India.Nice product.....it is same as u shown in the figures....its my first and the best experience to shop through amazon....I'm loving itthis device is not good very problems occur.sound ic breakdown after some days, touch not working properly. some time hang ect.Am not satisfied in this mobile I only use just 2 minutes it's fully heating and it's shield opened and touch is not working properlypls dont purchase this phone very bad experience with this phone hang problem sensor not working properly, voice problem within callnot bad compare to other handsetGooood phone but clour is avrageworth it . great looks at this price point . i love this stylish phone ..it has all features and functions .. great battery life ..i hate this phone  Whenever we use for long time it's screen washout... and very long battery charging time very poor touch screenMicromax Cancas Juice 2 is a nice phone in this range..With-2Gb Ram8Gb InternalNice looking mobile phone.Nice phone in the price range.
